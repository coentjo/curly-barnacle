       " Document(page_content='Foreword\\nIf you are writing your ﬁrst web application, you may look at Seaside and\\nthink, “What’s the fuss? This looks a lot like writing any other application.”\\nBut those of you who bear the scars of hours spent extracting POST variables,\\nworrying about entity encoding, and passing data from page to page to page\\nwill understand the signiﬁcance of this carefully crafted illusion.\\nAvi Bryant and I created Seaside because we wanted to spend our time writing\\ngreat applications instead of worrying about what to name our form ﬁelds.\\nIf you actually like spending your time thinking about form ﬁeld names –\\nnot to mention headers, cookies, URLs, redirects, session keys, and so on –\\nthen you should probably stop reading now. If, like we did, you believe there\\nmust be a better way, then keep reading. You can still deal with most of those\\ndetails manually, of course; you just won’t need to.\\nA handful of experienced core developers and early adopters have collabo-\\nrated on this book to show you how to develop for the web and let Seaside\\nhandle the distractions. And once you’ve ﬁnished your ﬁrst Seaside applica-\\ntion, I’m willing to bet it won’t be your last. Some people ﬁnd the “Seaside\\nway” of doing things a little foreign at ﬁrst; others feel immediately at home.\\nBut, once they’ve mastered it, most developers just can’t stand the idea of\\ngoing back.\\nPaul Graham observes in his essay “Beating the Averages” that web develop-\\nment is unique in giving you complete freedom to choose any development\\ntools you want. Your users don’t care (or even know) that you wrote your\\napplication with Seaside. But you should (and so should your competitors)\\nbecause it could be your competitive advantage. In an industry where late,\\nover-budget, and under-performing projects are the unfortunate norm, de-\\nlivering on your promises can set you apart. Using Seaside, you can deliver\\nmore in less time and when the requirements change you can adapt more\\nquickly.\\nOne of my ﬁrst Seaside projects, with a small team at a university, was\\nan application to manage Curriculum Vitae.

Also, our users had suffered through at least\\ntwo previous attempts to force similar (failed) initiatives on them so we\\nwanted to build support by engaging them fully in the development process.\\nAll this meant that our requirements were continuously evolving.\\nFrom the outset we arranged regular meetings with users and partners. We\\ndemonstrated the system, collected feedback, even prototyped ideas on the\\nspot. For more complex requests, we took notes and promised to get back to\\nthem next week. After these meetings, I think most people were certain they\\nwould never hear from us again but we took pride in proving them wrong.\\nSeaside allowed us to quickly develop the most promising ideas and get back\\nto them – often within 24 hours – with something to look at. That builds real\\nsupport.\\nSeaside began as a simple development tool but has grown into a mature\\nframework, now the most productive web development environment I know.\\nIt has helped a humbling and fast-growing community of talented users and\\ndevelopers rediscover the joy of programming for the web.

       " Document(page_content='Chapter 1\\nIntroduction\\nSeaside is an excellent framework for easily developing advanced and dy-\\nnamic web applications. Seaside lets you create reusable components that\\nyou can freely compose using Smalltalk – a simple and pure object-oriented\\nlanguage.\\nSeaside offers a powerful callback mechanism that lets you trigger code\\nsnippets when the users clicks on a link. With Seaside, you can debug your\\nweb application with a powerful dynamic debugger and modify the code on\\nthe ﬂy while your server is running. This makes the development of complex\\ndynamic applications smooth and fast.\\nWith Seaside, you have the time to focus on your design and solutions to your\\nproblems. In this chapter, we give an overview of Seaside and present some\\nSmalltalk basics to help you to follow along with the book. In the next chapter,\\nwe will show you how youcan program your ﬁrst Seaside component in just\\n15 minutes.\\n1.1 What is Seaside?\\nSeaside is a free, open source framework (collection of Smalltalk classes). The\\ndeveloper can use and extend these classes to produce highly dynamic web-\\nbased applications . By applications, we mean real applications with potentially\\ncomplex workﬂows and user interactions, in contrast to just collections of\\nstatic pages. Seaside makes web development simpler and can help you build\\napplications that are cleaner and easier to maintain because it has:\\n• a solid component model and callbacks,\\n• support for sequencing interactions,\\n3', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 14}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='4 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\\n• native (Smalltalk) debugging interface, and\\n• support for using AJAX and other Web 2.0 technologies.\\nSeaside applications are based on the composition of independent compo-\\nnents. Each component is responsible for its rendering, its state, and its own\\ncontrol ﬂow. Seaside enables you to freely compose such components, creat-\\ning advanced and dynamic applications comparable to widget libraries such\\nas Swing or Morphic. What is really powerful is that the control ﬂow of an\\napplication is written in plain Smalltalk code.\\nSeaside was originally created by Avi Bryant and Julian Fitzell. It is supported\\nby an active community and enhanced by several Seaside experts. Currently,\\nJulian Fitzell, Philippe Marshall, and Lukas Renggli (one of the authors of\\nthis book), are leading its development.\\nSeaside is often described as a heretic web framework because by design it goes\\nagainst what is currently considered best practice for web development – such\\nas using templates or clean, carefully chosen, meaningful URLs. Seaside does\\nnot follow REST (Representational State Transfer) by default. Instead, URLs\\nhold session key information, and meaningful URLs have to be generated\\nexplicitly, if needed.\\nWhen using a template system (PHP , JSP , ASP , ColdFusion, and so on), the\\nlogic is scattered across many ﬁles, which makes the application hard to\\nmaintain. Reuse, if possible at all, is often based on copying ﬁles. The\\nphilosophy of the template approach is to separate the responsibilities of\\ndesigners and programmers. This is a good idea that Seaside also embraces.\\nSeaside encourages the developer to use CSS to describe the visual appearance\\nof a component, but it does not use a templating engine, and encourages\\ndevelopers to programmatically generate meaningful and valid XHTML\\nmarkup.\\nSeaside is easy to learn and use. By comparison, JSF (JavaServer Faces)\\nrequires you to use and understand several technologies such as Servlets,\\nXML, JSP , navigation conﬁguration in faces.config ﬁles, and so on. In Seaside,\\nyou only need to know Smalltalk, which is more compact and easier to learn\\nthan Java. Furthermore, it is good to know some basics about CSS. Seaside lets\\nyou to concentrate on the problem at hand and not on integrating technologies.\\nSeaside ensures that you always generate valid XHTML and that all your\\ncode is in Smalltalk.\\nIn summary, several aspects of Seaside’s design differ from most mainstream\\nweb application frameworks. In Seaside\\n• Session state is maintained on the server.\\n•XHTML is generated completely in Smalltalk. There are no templates\\nor “server pages” although it isn’t hard to build such things in Seaside.', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 15}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='1.2. SEASIDE APPLICATIONS 5\\n•You use callbacks for anchors and buttons, rather than loosely coupled\\npage references and request IDs.\\n•You use plain Smalltalk to deﬁne the ﬂow of your application. You do\\nnot need a dedicated language or XML conﬁguration ﬁles.\\nCombined, these features make working with Seaside much like writing a\\ndesktop GUI application. Actually, in some ways it is simpler, since the web\\nbrowser takes a lot of the application details out of your hands.\\nThe next section lists some real-world Seaside applications that you can\\nbrowse to understand the kind of applications you can build with Seaside.\\nEach of these applications allows complex interaction with the user, rather\\nthan a simple collection of pages.\\n1.2 Seaside Applications\\nWith Seaside, you will be able to build any kind of web application. You\\ncan see some Seaside applications running on the web. You can ﬁnd more\\ninformation at seaside.st /about /users. Seaside is used in many intranet web\\napplications, that are often not readily visible without going behind the\\nscenes.\\nWe have selected two Seaside examples from the publicly available projects.\\nHave a look at them to see the kind of interaction and application ﬂow that\\ncan be built with Seaside.\\nYesplan (www.yesplan.be)\\nYesplan is a collaborative event planning web application. A video\\non the website shows a nice summary of the application. The user\\ninteraction and smooth application ﬂow is really striking and a good\\nillustration of the power of Seaside to build complex applications.\\nCmsbox (www.cmsbox.ch)\\nAn AJAX-based content management system designed for usability.\\nHere the navigation is more the kind we expect from a web application.\\nThere are also several open-source projects based on Seaside; we list two in-\\nteresting ones, since you may use them when going through the book.\\nPier (www.piercms.com)\\nPier is a kind of meta content management system into which a Seaside\\napplication can be plugged.

It’s a relevant question, and there is an answer; there are several\\ngood reasons why it is so innovative. First, the design of Smalltalk is still\\none of the best in terms of elegance, purity, and consistency. Second, the\\nset of tools is really good: debuggers, browsers, refactoring engines, and\\nunit testing frameworks were all invented in Smalltalk. Third, and most\\nimportant, in Smalltalk you constantly interact with live objects. This is\\nparticularly exciting when developing web applications. There’s no need to\\nconstantly recompile your code or restart the server. Instead, you debug your\\napplications on the ﬂy, recompile running code, and access your business\\nobjects right in the browser, which gives you a huge productivity gain.\\nExperience has proven to us that Smalltalk is not difﬁcult to learn, it provides\\nmany advantages and it’s no hindrance to using Seaside. In fact we often see\\npeople starting to learn Smalltalk because of Seaside. To help you get up to\\nspeed, we suggest you read Pharo by Example . It is a free book available at\\nwww.pharobyexample.org. Chapters 3, 4 and 5 contain a minimal description\\nof Smalltalk, its object-oriented model and the elementary syntax elements\\nthat you need to know to follow this book. In the next chapter, we will help\\nyou to get started with the environment step by step.\\n1.3.1 One-Click Image\\nThere are several implementations of Smalltalk. Some are commercial, such as\\nCincom Smalltalk, GemStone Smalltalk, VA Smalltalk, and Dolphin Smalltalk.\\nOthers are open source, such as Pharo, Squeak and GNU Smalltalk. Seaside\\nis developed in Pharo, then ported to the other Smalltalks. The ﬁrst chapter\\nprovides an equivalent of a “Getting Started” chapter to all major Smalltalk\\nimplementations.', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 17}),\n",

This book is based on\\nPharo Smalltalk, a fork of Squeak that is used to build the One Click Image.\\nWe suggest you use this image to start. It makes things much simpler.\\nThe Seaside mailing list is a good place to ask questions because the sub-\\nscribers to the list answer questions quickly. Do not hesitate to join and\\nparticipate in the community.\\nOkay then, you now have tools at your disposal to help you through any\\nproblems you might encounter.\\n1.4 Structure of the Book\\nPart I: Getting Started\\nExplains how to get a Seaside application up and running in less than\\n15 minutes. It will show you some Seaside tools.\\nPart II: Fundamentals\\nShows you how to manipulate basic elements, such as text, anchors,\\nand callbacks, as well as forms. It presents the notion of a brush , which\\nis central to the Seaside API.\\nPart III: Using Components\\nDescribes components, the basic building blocks of Seaside. It shows\\nhow components are deﬁned and can populate the screen or be called\\nand embedded within one another. It also presents tasks that are control\\nﬂow components and describes how reuse is achieved in Seaside via\\ncomponent decoration. It ends with a discussion of the Slime library,\\nwhich checks and validates your Seaside code.\\nPart IV: Seaside In Action\\nThis part develops two little applications – a todo list manager and\\na sudoku player. Then it presents how to serve ﬁles, a discussion of\\ncharacter encodings, and how to customize a session to hold application-\\ncentric information.\\nPart V: Web 2.0\\nThis part describes how to create an RSS feed, as well as the details\\nof integrating JavaScript into an application. It ﬁnishes by showing\\nsome push technology such as Comet , which allows you to synchronize\\nmultiple applications.', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 18}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"8 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\\nPart VI: Advanced\\nPresents some details that you face when you conﬁgure and deploy\\na Seaside application. It shows how to test Seaside components, and\\ndiscusses Seaside security by presenting the most common attacks and\\nhow Seaside deals with them effectively. Then, even though Seaside\\nis not about persistency, we discuss some persistency approaches in\\nSqueak. Finally, we present Magritte, a meta-data framework, and its\\nSeaside integration. Magritte lets you generate forms on the ﬂy.\\n1.5 Formatting Conventions\\nWe need to say a word about formatting conventions before we proceed. In\\nPharo, as in most Smalltalk implementations, you edit code using a code\\nbrowser as we will show you in the next Chapter. To look at the code for a\\nmethod, you select a package, then a class, a method category and ﬁnally the\\nmethod you want to see. The method’s class is always visible. When reading\\na book, a method’s class may not be so obvious.\\nTo help your understanding of the code we present, we will follow a common\\nconvention to display Smalltalk code: we will preﬁx a method signature with\\nits class name. Here is an example. Suppose you need to enter the method\\nrenderContentOn: in your browser, and this method is in the class: WebSudoku .\\nYou will see the following code in your browser.\\nrenderContentOn: html\\nhtml div\\nid: ' board ' ;\\nwith: [ html form: [ self renderBoardOn: html ] ]\\nTo help you remember that this method is deﬁned in the class WebSudoku , we\\nwill write it as follows:\\nWebSudoku>>renderContentOn: html\\nhtml div\\nid: ' board ' ;\\nwith: [ html form: [ self renderBoardOn: html ] ]\\nWhen you enter the text for this method, you do not type WebSudoku >>. It\\nis there only so you will know the method’s class. We will use a similar\\nconvention in the running text. To be precise about a method and its class,\\nwe will use WebSudoku >> renderContentOn: .\\nIn Smalltalk, a class and an instance of a class both have methods. The class\\nmethods are analogous to static methods in Java. Class methods respond to\\nmessages sent to the class itself. To make it clear that we are talking about\\na class method, we will refer to it using WebSudoku class >> canBeRoot . For\", metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 19}),\n",

Within 15 minutes, you will install and launch\\nSeaside, interact with a Smalltalk IDE and write a simple Seaside counter\\napplication. You will follow the entire procedure of creating a Seaside appli-\\ncation. This process will highlight some of the features of Seaside. If you are\\nnew to Smalltalk, we suggest you to read chapters 3, 4 and 5 of Pharo by Exam-\\nplewhich is a free and online book available from www.pharobyexample.org.\\nThis will highlight some of the features of Smalltalk.\\nAs we mentioned previously, there are several implementations of Smalltalk.\\nSome are commercial, such as VisualWorks, VA Smalltalk, Gemstone, and\\nDolphin. Others are open source, such as Pharo, Squeak and GNU Smalltalk;\\nand ﬁnally, some are free but not open source, such as Smalltalk /X. Seaside is\\ndeveloped in Pharo, then ported to the other Smalltalks.\\n2.1 Using the One Click Image\\nIn this book, we use Seaside 3.0.4, included in the “One Click Image” which\\nyou can ﬁnd on the Seaside website at www.seaside.st /download. The “One\\nClick Image” is a bundle of everything you need to run Seaside, including\\nthe Pharo implementation of Smalltalk.

Smalltalk was ﬁrst used with three-button mice, and some\\nadvanced features of Pharo may require you to emulate a three-button mouse.\\nThe ’third-button’ may be bound to another button on your mouse, or the\\nmouse scroll-wheel. Alternatively it may require you to press a key while\\nclicking – the Alt key or the Command (Apple) keys on Macs are common\\nchoices. You shouldn’t worry about this until you need it, but it’s useful to\\nknow just in case you accidentally invoke one of these actions and wonder\\nwhere it came from.\\nWorld Menu. To launch new applications and open new windows, you will\\nuse the World Menu. This can be opened by clicking anywhere on your\\nSeaside desktop (i.e., left-clicking on the background area). We will use a\\nshorthand to refer to this: World |Workspace means \"click on the desktop to\\nbring up the World Menu, then select the Workspace entry\".\\nWorkspace. When you want to execute some code, you do so by opening a\\nnew workspace from the World Menu: use World |Workspace .\\nTry this new knowledge out now: Open a new workspace window. Type 1 +\\n1into the window, and select it. Now right-click and select Print it from the\\ncontext menu. You should see the answer 2.\\n2.2 What is a Smalltalk Image?\\nAll Smalltalk objects live in something called an image. An image is a snap-\\nshot of memory containing all the objects at a given point in time. This means\\nthat your business objects, Seaside objects, all classes and their methods (since\\nthey are also objects), and development tools are all part of the image. The\\nSeaside “One Click Image” includes a Smalltalk image with Seaside and a\\nnumber of other tools pre-loaded to make it easier for you to get started using\\nSeaside.\\nAn image is loaded and executed by a virtual machine. When you ran Pharo in\\nSection 2.1 you really were running the virtual machine on the pre-packaged\\n“One Click Image” image. For the sake of brevity we call this “running the\\nimage.” The Smalltalk image includes active processes (Smalltalk processes\\nare more akin to “threads” in other languages). When you load an image\\nfrom a disk ﬁle you bring objects that were part of that image into RAM and\\nresume execution of the active processes that were part of that image. If you\\nwere debugging when you saved the image, you’ll still be debugging when\\nyou load that image. We like to think of this as “picking up where you left\\noff” (note that there are limits to this model: transient objects like a network\\nconnection that was active when the image was saved will not be available\\nwhen the image is re-loaded). As an example, the Seaside “One Click Image”\\nimage was saved with the Comanche web server running so, when you load', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 30}),\n",

We’ll say more about that\\nlater.\\nDevelopment in Pharo involves making incremental changes to the image\\n(by creating classes, methods etc.). You will want to periodically save your\\nSmalltalk image to disk so that your changes are saved. To save your image,\\nselect World |Save (i.e., raise the world menu by clicking somewhere in the\\nbackground of the Pharo window, and click “Save” in that menu, as described\\npreviously). If you quit Pharo using World |Quit , you will also be prompted\\nto save your image. You may resume your development efforts by running\\nthe image, as we did in Section 2.1.\\n2.3 The Comanche Server\\nThe “One Click Image” image includes a web server called “Comanche”\\nlistening on TCP port 8080. You should check that this server is properly\\nrunning by pointing your web browser to http: //localhost:8080 /. You should\\nsee something like Figure 2.2. If you don’t see this page, it is possible that\\nport 8080 is already in use by another application on your computer.\\nFigure 2.2: The Seaside server running.\\nChanging the Seaside port number. If you did not see Figure 2.2, you will\\nneed to try modifying the workspace to restart the Comanche web server on\\na different port number (like 8081).

Once you have found an available\\nport, make sure you note what port the server is running on. Throughout this\\nbook we assume port 8080 so if you’re using a different port you will have to\\nmodify any URLs we give you accordingly.\\n2.4 A First Seaside Component\\nNow we are ready to write our ﬁrst Seaside component. We are going to\\ncode a simple counter. To do this we will deﬁne a component, add some\\nstate to that component, and then create a couple of methods that deﬁne how\\nthe component is rendered in the web browser. We will then register it as\\na Seaside application.

The menu can be found by right-\\nclicking onto the list pane. You will get prompted to give a name as shown in\\nFigure 2.3. We will use the name WebCounter for our category.\\nFigure 2.4 shows that the category has been created. Now we are ready to\\ndeﬁne a component.\\nIn Pharo images you will often ﬁnd the terms “Package” and “Category‘”\\nused interchangeably. “Category” is a technical term based on the internal\\nimplementation, while “Package” better describes the intent of this pane.\\nFrom now on, we will be using the term “Package”.\\n2.4.2 Deﬁning a Component\\nNow we will deﬁne a new component named WebCounter .

DEVELOPING IN VISUALWORKS 41\\n3.5.2 Packages and Categories\\nSmalltalk systems have traditionally provided class categories to help orga-\\nnize classes into related clusters. They had no semantic value, and were not\\nrepresented by objects. In VisualWorks, categories have been supplanted by\\npackages.\\nUnlike traditional categories, VisualWorks packages are real objects (instances,\\nsurprisingly enough, of the class PackageModel). They provide the organi-\\nzation feature of categories, but they are also the basic archival unit for the\\nStore repository.\\nWhen developing application code, you should create your own new package\\nto contain this work, rather than use an existing package. To create a new\\npackage, make sure no package is selected (Ctrl-click to deselect, or just select\\nLocal Image) in the System Browser, then pick Package |New... and enter a\\nname in the dialog.\\n3.5.3 Name Spaces\\nBecause of the strong potential for class and (global) variable name colli-\\nsions in large VisualWorks applications, VisualWorks has implemented name\\nspaces, a mechanism for restricting the referential scope of such names.\\nWhile advanced usage of name spaces can be quite involved and intricate, in\\npractice can be quite simple, especially in the context of a Seaside application.\\nEssential points are that:\\n• The top-level name space is named Smalltalk.\\n•All VisualWorks base Smalltalk classes and add-ons are deﬁned in\\nsub-namespaces of Smalltalk.\\n• Most Seaside classes are in the name space named Seaside.\\nYour application should, in general, be in a name space that you create for\\nyour own usage.

You will learn how to create a component which could\\ninclude text, a form, a picture, or anything else that you would like to display\\nin a web browser. Seaside’s component framework is one of its most power-\\nful features and writing an application in Seaside amounts to creating and\\nmanipulating components. You will learn how to use Seaside’s API, which is\\nbased on the concept of “brushes”, to generate valid XHTML.\\nOne of the great features of Seaside is that you do not have to worry about\\nmanipulating HTML yourself and creating valid XHTML. Seaside produces\\nvalid XHTML: it automatically generates HTML markup using valid tags, it\\nensures that the tags are nested correctly and it closes the tags for you.\\nLet’s look at a simple example: to force a line-break in HTML (for instance,\\nto separate the lines of a postal address) you need to use a break tag: < br/>.\\nSome people use < br>or< br></ br>, and neither is valid in XHTML. Some\\nbrowsers will accept these incorrect forms without a problem, but some will\\nmark them as errors. If your content is getting passed on through RSS or\\nAtom clients, it may fail in unexpected ways. You do not need to worry about\\nany of this when using Seaside.\\nThe basic metaphor used in Seaside for rendering HTML is one of painting\\non a canvas using brushes . Methods such as renderContentOn: that are called\\nto render content are passed an argument (by convention named html) that\\nrefers to the current canvas object. To render content on this object you can\\ncall its methods (or to use the correct Smalltalk terminology, you can pass\\nit messages). In the simple example given above, to add a line-break to a\\ndocument you would use html break .\\n79', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 90}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"80 CHAPTER 7. RENDERING COMPONENTS\\nWhen you send a message to the canvas, you’re actually asking it to start\\nusing a new brush . Each brush is associated with a speciﬁc type of HTML tag,\\nand can be passed arguments deﬁning more detail of what you want to be\\nrendered. So to write out a paragraph of text, you would use html paragraph\\nwith: 'This is the text' . This tells the canvas to start using the paragraph\\nbrush (which causes ‘ < p>’ to be output), then output the text passed as the\\nargument, and ﬁnally to ﬁnish using the brush (which causes ‘ </ p>’ to be\\noutput).\\nMany brushes can be passed multiple messages before they are ﬁnished,\\nby chaining the messages together with ;(this is called cascading messages\\nin Smalltalk). For example, a generic heading exists which can be used to\\ngenerate HTML headings at various levels, by passing it a level: message\\nwith an argument specifying the level of heading required:\\nhtml heading\\nlevel: 3;\\nwith: ' A third level heading ' .\\nThis will produce the HTML:\\n<h3>A third level heading</h3>\\nYou can cascade as many messages as you need to each brush object.\\nYou can easily tell Seaside to nest tags by using Smalltalk blocks:\\nhtml paragraph: [\\nhtml text: ' The next word is ' .\\nhtml strong: ' bold ' ].\\nThis will produce the HTML:\\n<p>The next word is <strong>bold</strong></p>\\nNote that we’ve used a very handy shortcut here: many of the brush meth-\\nods have an equivalent method that can be called with a single argument\\nso instead of typing html paragraph with: 'text' you need only type html\\nparagraph: 'text' .\\nThis is a very brief introduction that will allow you to begin to experiment\\nwith how these techniques can be combined into a larger piece of content, as\\nyou will see in the following sections.\\n7.1 Rendering Hello World\\nOur ﬁrst Seaside component will simply display Hello world .

For now, just think of subclasses of WAComponent as\\n“visual components”. When it is time for a component to be displayed, Seaside\\nsends it the message WAComponent >> renderContentOn: with a single argument\\n(by convention called html) which is an instance of the class WARenderCanvas\\n(the “canvas”). Think of the canvas as the medium on which you will paint\\nyour component. It provides a transparent interface to XHTML which makes\\nit easy to produce text, anchors, images etc., in a modular way (i.e., attached\\nto each component of your application). To start, we just want to show a\\nsimple text message. Fortunately the canvas supports a text: message for\\njust this purpose, which we can use as shown below.\\nNote that all the classes in Seaside are preﬁxed with WAwhich acts as a\\nnamespace.

This choice makes your\\nmethods a lot more readable than if the XHTML tags were used everywhere.\\nCompare the following two code fragments.\\n\"This is not working code\"\\nhtml p with: \\' Hello world. \\' .\\nhtml ol with: [\\nhtml li: \\' Item 1 \\' .\\nhtml li: \\' Item 2 \\' ].\\n\"Working version\"\\nhtml paragraph with: \\' Hello world. \\' .\\nhtml orderedList with: [\\nhtml listItem: \\' Item 1 \\' .\\nhtml listItem: \\' Item 2 \\' ].', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 105}),\n",

Keep in mind that the method you’re interested\\nin may be in a superclass, see the hierarchy below.\\nNormally, the brush conﬁguration methods that set tag attributes, use the\\nsame name as the attribute. So, for example, to set the altText attribute\\nfor an IMG(image) tag you’d send the image brush the WAImageTag >> altText:\\nmessage. If you don’t know the tag attribute you need to open a class browser\\non the speciﬁc brush class. Once again, keep in mind that the method you’re\\ninterested in may be in a superclass.

If your\\nmethod gets longer than a couple of lines create intention-revealing\\nhelper methods following the naming pattern renderSomethingOn: .

There are many good CSS references which\\nshow you how to lay out pages.\\n7.9 Summary\\nWe have shown that you can specify the visual aspect of your component\\nusing the Seaside brush API. These brushes will make it easy to produce valid\\nXHTML code. We have also demonstrated that you can use all the power\\nof Smalltalk to specify your content, and that all the visual aspects of your\\napplication can be speciﬁed using CSS.\\nThe method renderContentOn: is automatically invoked by Seaside. It allows\\nyou to specify the output of the application. Brushes are used to paint XHTML\\ntags onto a canvas object. Blocks are used to create a scope within tags. For\\nexample:\\nhtml paragraph with: [ html render: ' today ' ]\\nrenders the string ’today’ within < p> today</ p>. A brush is an expression of\\nthe form:\\nhtml brush\\nattributes1;\\nattributes2;\\nwith: anObject\\nCode can be made more compact in two ways.\\n1.When the nested expression is a single object you can avoid blocks. The\\nexpression html paragraph with: [ html render: 'today' ] is equiv-\\nalent to html paragraph with: 'today' .\\n2.When you don’t need to conﬁgure the brush’s attributes, you don’t\\nneed to use with: . The expression html paragraph with: 'today' is\\nequivalent to html paragraph: 'today' .\\nIn conclusion the following three code snippets create exactly the same output.\\nFor readability and to avoid having to type unnecessary code, we usually\\nchoose the shortest version possible:\\nhtml paragraph with: [ html render: ' today ' ].\\nhtml paragraph with: ' today ' .\\nhtml paragraph: ' today ' .\", metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 112}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Chapter 8\\nCSS in a Nutshell\\nIn this chapter we present CSS in a nutshell and show how Seaside helps\\nyou to use CSS in your applications. The goal of the chapter is not to replace\\nCSS tutorials, many of which can be found on the web. Rather, the goal\\nis to establish some basic principles and show how Seaside facilitates the\\ndecoupling of information and its visual presentation in web browsers. A\\nclear separation between the page components and their rendering is really\\ncentral to Seaside. Sometimes this frustrates newcomers because Seaside does\\nnot use template mechanisms for rendering. However, the Seaside approach\\nallows the clear separation between the responsibilities of the web designer\\nand the web developer. The developer is not responsible for rendering and\\nlayout of the application, this is the job of the web designer.\\nThe idea behind CSS is to decouple the presentation from the document itself.\\nThe tags in a document are interpreted using a CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)\\nwhich deﬁnes the layout and style of the rendered document. In the context\\nof Seaside, the component rendering methods generate XHTML and the CSS\\nassociated with the application speciﬁes how such components should be\\ndisplayed and placed on the page.\\n8.1 CSS Principles\\nBasically, a CSS speciﬁcation contains a set of rules. A rule is a description\\nof a stylistic aspect of one or more elements. A rule is composed of a selector\\nand a declaration . In the following rule h1is a selector which speciﬁes that\\nthe following declaration color: red will be applied to all the ﬁrst-level\\nheadings, see Figure 8.1. The rule has the effect that all the ﬁrst level headings\\nwill be red.\\n103', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 114}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='104 CHAPTER 8. CSS IN A NUTSHELL\\nh1 { color: red; }\\nA declaration is composed of two parts separated by a colon and ended with\\na semicolon. The ﬁrst part is the property being speciﬁed, and the second is\\nthevalue assigned to that property.\\nWe can group multiple CSS selectors to share the same property. The follow-\\ning rules:\\nh1 { color: red; }\\nh2 { color: red; }\\nh3 { color: red; }\\nare equivalent to this single rule:\\nh1, h2, h3 { color: red; }\\nSimilarly, it is possible to assign several values to a single selector. For exam-\\nple, the following rule changes the alignment and color of headings.\\nFigure 8.1: Essential CSS structural elements.\\nh1 { color: red; text-align: center; }\\nMost declarations are inherited from higher levels of your document tree.\\nCSS property values assigned to one element are transferred down the tree to\\nits descendants. For example, a property value set in the body of a document\\nwill be propagated to all its children, which may then redeﬁne the value\\nlocally. This is true for color, font, etc., but not for other properties like width,\\nheight, and positioning, for which inheriting would not make sense.\\nWhile CSS declarations can be embedded in your document using a style\\ntag, it is a good practice to have your CSS in a separate ﬁle. Then, if you were\\nwriting your XHTML by hand, you would add a reference to your CSS ﬁle in\\nthe head section of your document as follows.', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 115}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='8.2. CSS SELECTORS 105\\n<head>\\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"mystyle.css\" />\\n</head>\\nIt’s not necessary to write this in Seaside though. The CSS will be served by\\nusing either the Seaside ﬁle library or with Apache, see Section 23.3.6. For\\nrapid prototyping, you can deﬁne the CSS of a component by overriding its\\nWAComponent >> style method.\\n8.2 CSS Selectors\\nCSS allows you to select individual elements of an XHTML document, or\\ngroups of elements that share some property. Let’s look at the different kind\\nof selectors and how they can be used.\\n8.2.1 Tag Selector\\nThe tag selector applies to speciﬁc XHTML tags, as we saw in the previous\\nexamples. The selector consists simply of the tag name as it appears in the\\nXHTML source, but without the angle brackets. The following example\\nremoves the underlining from all anchor elements and changes the base font-\\nsize of the text within the page to 20 points. The body tag is one of the top-level\\ntags automatically created by Seaside enclosing the whole page.\\na { text-decoration: none; }\\nbody { font-size: 20pt; }\\n8.2.2 Class Selector\\nThe class selector is by far the most often used CSS selector. It starts with a pe-\\nriod and usually deﬁnes a visual property that can be added to XHTML\\ntags. The following CSS fragment deﬁnes the center and the highlight\\nclasses.\\n.center { text-align: center; }\\n.highlight { color: yellow; }\\nTo use class selectors, simply set the WAGenericTag >> class: attribute of the\\ntag you want to change. Here we associate the class selector .center to a\\ngiven div element and .highlight to a given paragraph.', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 116}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='106 CHAPTER 8. CSS IN A NUTSHELL\\nhtml div\\nclass: \\' center \\' ;\\nwith: \\' Seaside is cool \\' .\\nhtml paragraph\\nclass: \\' highlight \\' ;\\nwith: \\' Highlighted text \\'\\nThe generated XHTML code looks like this:\\n<div class=\"center\">Seaside is cool</div>\\n<p class=\"highlight\">Highlighted text</p>\\nMultiple classes can be added to a single XHTML tag. So the following code\\nwill display a single text that is centered and highlighted:\\nhtml div\\nclass: \\' center \\' ;\\nclass: \\' highlight \\' ;\\nwith: \\' Centered and Highlighted \\'\\nThe generated XHTML code looks like this:\\n<div class=\"center highlight\">Centered and Highlighted</div>\\nOften CSS classes are used to conditionally highlight certain elements of a\\npage depending on the state of the application. Seaside provides the conve-\\nnience method WAGenericTag >> class:if: to make this as concise as possible.\\nThe following code snippet creates ten divtags and adds the CSS class even\\nonly if the condition index even evaluates to true. This is shorter than to\\nmanually build an ifTrue:ifFalse: construct.\\n1 to: 10 do: [ :index |\\nhtml div\\nclass: \\' even \\' if: index even;\\nwith: index ]\\n8.2.3 Pseudo Class Selector\\nPseudo classes are similar to CSS classes, but they don’t appear in the XHTML\\nsource code. They are automatically applied to elements by the web browser,\\nif certain conditions apply. These conditions can be related to the content,\\nor to the actions that the user is carrying out while viewing the page. To\\ndistinguish pseudo classes from normal CSS selectors they all start with a\\ncolon.\\n:focus { background-color: yellow; }\\n:hover { font-weight: bold; }', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 117}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='8.2. CSS SELECTORS 107\\nThe ﬁrst rule speciﬁes that elements (typically input ﬁelds of a form) get\\na yellow background, if they have focus. The second rule speciﬁes that all\\nelements will appear in bold while the mouse cursor hovers over them.\\nThe following table gives a brief overview of pseudo classes supported by\\nmost of today’s browsers:\\n:active Matches an activated element, e.g. a link that is clicked.\\n:first-child Matches the ﬁrst child of another element.\\n:first-letter Matches the ﬁrst character within an element.\\n:first-line Matches the ﬁrst line of text within an element.\\n:focus Matches an element that has the focus.\\n:hover Matches an element below the mouse pointer.\\n:link Matches an unvisited link.\\n:visited Matches a visited link.\\n8.2.4 Reference or ID Selector\\nA reference or ID is the name of a particular XHTML element on the page.\\nThus, the given style will affect only the element with the unique ID error\\n(if deﬁned). The ID selector is indicated by preﬁxing the ID with a #charac-\\nter:\\n#error { background-color: red; }\\nTo create a tag with the given ID use the following Seaside code:\\nhtml div\\nid: \\' error \\' ;\\nwith: \\' Some error message \\'\\nThe generated XHTML code looks like this:\\n<div id=\"error\">Some error message</div>\\nThere are a couple of issues to be aware of when using IDs in your XHTML.\\nIDs have to be unique on a XHTML page. If you use the same ID multiple\\ntimes, some web browsers may not render your page as you expect, or\\nmay even refuse to render it at all. Furthermore some Javascript libraries\\ndynamically apply their own IDs to identify page elements and these may\\noverride your carefully chosen IDs, causing your styling to fail in mysterious\\nways. See Part V on Javascript programming.\\nSo, to avoid invalid XHTML and conﬂicts with JavaScript code, do not use\\nIDs for styling. Exclusively use CSS classes for styling, even if the particular\\nstyle is used only once.Important', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 118}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='108 CHAPTER 8. CSS IN A NUTSHELL\\n8.3 Composed Selectors\\nCSS selectors can be composed in various ways to give you more control over\\nwhich page elements they select.\\nConjunction. If you concatenate selectors without any spaces, it means that\\nthe matching element must satisfy all given selectors. This is generally used\\nto reﬁne the application of class or pseudo-class selectors. For example, we\\ncan write div.error in the style sheet and this will affect only the divtags that\\nalso have the class error . Similarly a:hover will only apply when the user\\nmoves their mouse over anchor tags. It might be tempting to specify multiple\\nclasses with .error.highlight . Even though this is part of the CSS standard,\\nit does not work in older versions of Internet Explorer.\\nDescendant. Another possibility is to combine selectors with a space. This\\nﬁnds all elements that match the ﬁrst term, then searches within each for\\ndescendant elements that match the second term (and so on). For example,\\ndiv .error selects all the elements within a divtag that have the CSS class\\nerror . Elements that have the class error but no divtag as one of its parents,\\nare not affected.\\nChild. Yet another possibility is to combine two selectors with >. For example,\\ndiv> .error . This selects all the tags with the class error that are direct\\nchildren of a divtag. Again this does not work in older versions of Internet\\nExplorer.\\nThere are a few more selectors available in modern web browsers to allow\\nother criteria such as matching adjacent siblings. Since these selectors are not\\nwidely implemented in web browsers yet, we don’t discuss them here.\\n8.4 Summary\\nStyling web applications is a broad topic. This chapter has shown you the\\nmost important things to get started. For most people this will be enough to\\nget a decent looking prototype up and running. For commercial applications\\nyou will often hire a graphic designer with experience of designing web pages.\\nOnce such designers have worked with you on the desired look and feel of\\nyour pages, they can provide you with a purpose built style-sheet. Using\\nthe techniques described in this chapter you will be able to integrate such\\nstyle-sheets with the content generated by your application to make it look\\nbeautiful.\\nWe have found the following two documents to be helpful in learning more\\nabout XHTML and CSS:', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 119}),\n",

Similarly\\nSeaside uses callbacks to hide the even greater complexities of allowing user\\ninteractions over the web.\\nTraditional web applications are stateless , that is, as soon as they have dis-\\nplayed a page to the user, they forget everything about that page. If the user\\nthen clicks a button on that page, the web application knows nothing about\\nwhat was on the page the user was looking at, how the user got there, what\\nchoices they had made previously, and so on. If the web developers want\\nto keep track of such information, they have to do so explicitly, by hiding\\ninformation on the web page, or by saving records into a datastore every\\ntime they send a page to the user. Setting up, accessing and managing these\\nstructures takes up much of the time and energy of web developers.\\nIn Seaside, you don’t have these problems: the current state of the program,\\nall its variables and methods, and its history, are all stored automatically\\nwhenever a page is sent to the user, and this information is all restored for you\\nbehind the scenes if the user then performs any actions on that page.\\nThis section will show you how to make use of all these features.

This canvas will be invalid at the time the callback is executed, as it\\nhas already been sent through the wire. Normally callbacks are not used for\\nrendering, with the exception of AJAX. In this case AJAX passes you a new\\nrenderer into the callback, never use the old one from the outer scope. This\\nmeans never refer to the html canvas argument in the rendering method in\\nwhich the callback is declared.\\nIt is sometimes better to put your callback code in a separate method so that\\nyou can use it from different callbacks or when subclassing your component.\\nSome callbacks also take an argument that contains the input entered by the\\nuser (more on this later).', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 125}),\n",

This is very straightforward because Seaside handles all the complexity\\nfor you, which is amazing when you consider what a mess this kind of interac-\\ntion is with many other web frameworks. Let’s look at what happens:\\n1.The user clicks on the anchor, causing the web browser to submit a\\nrequest to Seaside.\", metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 130}),\n",

In\\nthis chapter we show how to create this form element and how to use these\\ncommon controls.\\n10.1 Text Input Fields and Buttons\\nLet’s continue with the same Contact domain model class that we used in\\nChapter 9. We wish to create a form that allows the user to update the name\\nand email address for a Contact . Smalltalkers are generally very careful to\\nseparate presentation from the core of the data model, so we will create a\\ncomponent that will hold the user interface code to allow the user to edit the\\nunderlying Contact instance:\\nWAComponent subclass: #ContactView\\ninstanceVariableNames: ' contact '\\nclassVariableNames: ''\\npoolDictionaries: ''\\ncategory: ' iAddress '\\nNotice that we’ve speciﬁed a contact instance variable; this will be used to\\nhold a reference to the instance of the Contact class that we want to edit.

       " Document(page_content='124 CHAPTER 10. FORMS\\nLook carefully at the contact method below. Before returning the value of\\nthe contact instance variable, it checks that it has been set. If it hasn’t been\\nset, the code in the block is executed which assigns a sensible value to the\\nvariable. This lazy initialisation is a common idiom in Smalltalk code. At\\nthe moment we want to test this component as a stand alone component,\\nso the accessor method will lazily load one of the contacts for us.Note\\nContactView>>contact\\n^ contact ifNil: [ contact := Contact contacts first ]\\nContactView>>contact: aContact\\ncontact := aContact\\nNext, we introduce our ﬁrst new canvas message: the message form. This\\nmethod returns an instance of WAFormTag . The only message in WAFormTag\\nof interest to us right now is with: which, as we’ve seen before, takes an\\nargument and renders that argument between the open and close XHTML\\ntags (i.e. the < form>and</ form>tags in this case). Controls such as input\\nﬁelds, buttons, popups, list boxes, and so on must all be placed inside a form\\nelement.\\nForgetting to add the form element is a common mistake. Controls such\\nas input ﬁelds, buttons, popups, list boxes etc., must all be placed inside\\na form tag. If not, they may not be rendered, or they may be rendered but\\nthen ignored by the browser.Important\\nOur form will have three elements: two text boxes, one each for the name and\\nthe email address; and a button for the user to submit their changes.\\nLet’s look ﬁrst at the text ﬁelds for the name and e-mail address inputs.\\nThese ﬁelds are created by the canvas’ textInput message which returns a\\nWATextInputTag . For each brush we use two methods value: and callback: .\\nThe value: method determines what should be put into this ﬁeld when it\\nis displayed to the user; here we use the accessor methods on the Contact\\ninstance to give these values. The callback: method takes a block that has\\na single argument. When the user submits the form, the block will have the\\nnew contents of the ﬁeld passed to it using this argument; here we use this to\\nupdate the Contact instance (via its accessor methods).\\nFinally we would like our component to have a Save button. We cre-\\nate a button with the canvas submitButton method, which answers a\\nWASubmitButtonTag .

They both deﬁne the contents\\nof the button of text input ﬁeld.Note\\nWhen the user’s browser submits this form, ﬁrst all the input callbacks are\\nprocessed, then the (single) submit button callback will be processed. The\\norder is important because the input callbacks set the corresponding ﬁeld in\\nthe Contact instance.

The initial value of an input ﬁeld often comes from an\\naccessor method on some class (for example self contact name ). Similarly\\nyour input ﬁeld callbacks will often look like those in the previous example,\\nand simply take the text that the user entered and store it using a similar\\nmethod name (for example self contact name: value ).

CONVENIENCE METHODS 127\\nhtml textInput on: #name of: self contact\\ninstead of:\\nhtml textInput\\ncallback: [ :value | self contact name: value ];\\nwith: self contact name\\nButtons. Similarly, the label of a submit button can often be inferred from the\\nname of the method it invokes. Submit button brushes provide the method\\non:of: , which does this automatically for you allowing you to write one\\nline:\\nhtml submitButton on: #save of: self\\ninstead of all of this:\\nhtml submitButton\\ncallback: [ self save ];\\nvalue: ' Save '\\nThe actual conversion from the selector name to the button label happens by\\nsending labelForSelector: to the second argument. The default implemen-\\ntation of this method simply capitalizes the ﬁrst letter of the selector and\\nreturns a string, but applications might decide to customize that method\\nby overriding it.Note\\nText ﬁelds. For text ﬁelds, the on:of: method takes the (symbol) name of the\\nproperty to be edited and the object which holds the property.\\nSpecifying method names. Seaside generates method names from the prop-\\nerty names using the usual Smalltalk accessor /mutator naming conventions.\\nFor example, a property called #name would use a method called name as an\\naccessor and a method called name: as a mutator. The accessor is used to\\nprovide the starting value for the ﬁeld and the mutator is used in a callback\\nto set the value of the property.\\nGenerating labels. For submit buttons, on:of: takes the name of the method\\nto invoke and the object to which to send the message. It will use the method\\nname to generate a label for the button with a bit of intelligence. The symbol\\n#save becomes the label “Save”, whereas the symbol #youCanUseCamelCase\\nbecomes “You Can Use Camel Case”. If you don’t like this translation, use the\\ncallback: and value: methods, as demonstrated in the last section.\\nSo, putting all these techniques to work, our render method could be changed\\nto:\", metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 138}),\n",

In Seaside,\\ncomponents are generally designed to have a direct relationship with the state\\nof some part of the underlying model, and to take advantage of their state to\\nchange the way they display themselves and interact with the user. The fact\\nthat this state is encapsulated locally in the component, rather than stored\\nglobally as “session state”, sets Seaside apart from most other web application\\ndevelopment frameworks. For example, a list can be made responsible for\\nholding the currently selected item or a calendar the currently selected date. In\\nfact, you’ve already started building your applications this way: in Chapter 10\\nthe ContactView knew which contact it was editing. Understanding how best\\nto use these stateful components, and how to build interactions between them,\\nallows us to build widgets just as we would for desktop applications.\\nYou have already seen how components can be created and how they can\\ndisplay themselves on the web page. This section will demonstrate how you\\ncan have more control over these processes and how components can interact\\nwith other components. You will see two forms of interaction. A component\\ncanembed content and functionality from other components into its own web\\npage; alternatively, it can callother components, allowing them to take over\\nits web page until they return a result to the main component. Tasks can be\\nused to give more control over these interactions.\\nYou will also see how a pre-deﬁned component can be given different be-\\nhaviour and appearance to allow it to be re-used in different ways. This reuse\\nis achieved in Seaside via component decoration .\\nFinally, you will see a discussion of “Slime”, which despite its name is an\\nextremely useful library to check and validate your Seaside code.', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 154}),\n",

Each component is responsible for its rendering, its state and its own\\ncontrol ﬂow. Seaside lets us freely compose and reuse such components to\\ncreate advanced and dynamic applications. You have already built several\\ncomponents. In this chapter, we will show how to reuse these components by\\n“calling” them in a modal way. Embedding components in other components\\nwill be discussed in the following chapter.\\n11.1 Displaying a Component Modally\\nSeaside components have the ability to specify that another component\\nshould be rendered (usually temporarily) in their place. This mechanism is\\ntriggered by the message call: . During callback processing, a component\\nmay send the message call: with another component as an argument. The\\ncomponent passed as an argument in this way can be referred to as the delegate .\\nThe call: method has two effects:\\n1.In subsequent rendering cycles, the delegate will be displayed in place\\nof the original component. This continues until the delegate sends the\\nmessage WAComponent >> answer to itself.\\n2.The current execution state of the calling method is suspended and does\\nnot return a value yet. Instead, Seaside renders the web page in the\\nbrowser (showing the delegate in place of the original component).\\nThe delegate may be a complex component with its own control ﬂow and state.\\nIf the delegate component later sends the message answer , then execution of\\n145', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 156}),\n",

Our goal is simple: in a\\nContactListView component, we will display a link to edit the contacts\\n(as shown in Figure 11.1), and when the user selects that link, display\\nthe ContactView on that Contact . We accomplish this using the call: mes-\\nsage.\\nFigure 11.1: New version of the ContactListView.\\nThe editContact: method is passed a contact as an argument.

The problem is that when you press the back button, the application\\ninterface and the underlying model can be out of sync. When you press the\\nback button, only the browser is involved and not the server and the server\\nhas no way to know that you changed. Therefore your UI can be out of\\nsync from its domain. Seaside offers you a way to control the back button\\neffect.\\nThere are two kinds of synchronization problems: UI state and model state.\\nSeaside offers a good solution for UI state synchronization.\\nExperiment with the problem. In this section, we show the back button prob-\\nlem and show how Seaside makes it easy to handle. Perform the following\\nexperiment.\\n1.Browse the WebCounter application that we developed in the ﬁrst chapter\\nof this book.\\n2.Click on the ++link to increase the value of the counter until the counter\\nshows a value of 5.\\n3. Press the back button two times: you should see 3 now.\\n4. Click on the ++link.\\nYour web browser does not show you 4 as you would expect, but instead\\ndisplays 6. This is because the WebCounter component was not aware that you\\nhad pressed the back button. This situation can also arise if you open two\\nwindows that interact with the same application.\\nSolving the Problem. Seaside offers an elegant way to ﬁx this problem. De-\\nﬁne the method WAComponent >> states so that it returns an array that contains\\nthe objects that you want to keep in sync. In our WebCounter example we want\\nto keep the count instance variable synchronized so we write the method as\\nfollows.\\nWebCounter>>states\\n^ Array with: count\\nThis is not really what we want because the Seaside backtracking support is\\nmostly intended for UI state and not model state.

You will\\nﬁnd it helpful later on if you need to have more control on how components\\nreplace each other.\\nThe method show: passes the control from the receiving component to the\\ncomponent given as the ﬁrst argument.

       " Document(page_content='166 CHAPTER 12. EMBEDDING COMPONENTS\\n12.4 Intercepting a Subcomponent’s Answer\\nComponents may be designed to support both standalone and embedded\\nuse. Such components often produce answers (send self answer: ) in re-\\nsponse to user actions. When the component is standalone the answer is\\nreturned to the caller, but if the component is embedded the answer is ig-\\nnored unless the parent component arranges to intercept it. In our example\\napplication the editor provides an answer when the user presses the “Save”\\nbutton (i.e. in ContactView >> save) but this answer is ignored. It is easy to\\nchange our application to make use of this information; let’s say we want\\nto give the user conﬁrmation that their data was saved. To accomplish\\nthis, change IAddress >> initialize and add the WAComponent >> onAnswer: be-\\nhaviour:\\nIAddress>>initialize\\nsuper initialize.\\neditor := ContactView new.\\neditor contact: self contacts first.\\neditor onAnswer: [ :answer | self inform: \\' Saved \\' ] \" <-- added \"\\nNow restart your application (press “New Session”) and try it out. When you\\npress the save button in the editor you should get a dialog tersely notifying\\nyou that your data is saved. Note that the component answer is passed into\\nthe block (although we didn’t use it in this example).\\nThe onAnswer: method is an important protocol for handling components and\\ntheir answer.\\n12.5 A Word about Reuse\\nSuppose you wanted a component that shows only the name and email of\\nour ContactView component. There are no special facilities in Seaside for\\ndoing this, so you may be tempted to use template methods and specialize\\nhooks in the subclasses. This may lead to the deﬁnition of empty methods in\\nsubclasses and may force you to deﬁne as many subclasses as situations you\\nwant to cover, for example if you want to create a SimpleContactView and a\\nReadyonlyContactView .\\nAn alternative approach is to build more advanced components using the\\nmessages perform: or perform:with: with a list of method selectors to be\\nsent:\\nsetOutlineForm\\n\"should be called during action phase\"\\nmethods := #(renderNameOn: renderEmailOn:)', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 177}),\n",

Here is an example where the rendering method does not wrap its\\ncontent in a form tag when the component is in embedded mode (i.e., when\\nit would expect its parent to have already created a form in which to embed\\nthis component).

Magritte is a frame-\\nwork which allows you to deﬁne descriptions for your domain objects. It then\\nuses these descriptions to perform automatic actions (loading, saving, gener-\\nating SQL...). The Magritte /Seaside integration allows one to automatically\\ngenerate forms and Seaside components from domain object described with\\nMagritte descriptions, see Chapter 26. Magritte also offers ways to construct\\ndifferent views on the same objects and so the possibility to create multiple\\nvarieties of components: either by selecting a subset of ﬁelds to display, or by\\noffering read-only or editable components. As such, it is an extremely useful\\naddition to plain Seaside.\\n12.6 Decorations\\nSometimes we would like to reuse a component while adding something to\\nit, such as an information message or extra buttons.

Tasks are de-\\nﬁned as subclasses of WATask , which implements the key method WATask >> go,\\nwhich is invoked as soon as a task is displayed and can call other compo-\\nnents.\\nLet’s start by building our ﬁrst example: a number guessing game (which\\nwas one of the ﬁrst Seaside tutorials). In this game, the computer selects a\\nrandom number between 1 and 100 and then proceeds to repeatedly prompt\\nthe user for a guess. The computer reports whether the guess is too high or\\ntoo low.

This is a common practice which allows one to change the\\nrendering or even the rendering framework without having to deal with the\\ninternal aspects of the model. Thus, we will begin by presenting a simple\\nmodel for a todo list that contains todo items as shown by Figure 15.1.\\nFigure 15.1: A simple model with items and an item container.\\nToDoItem Class.

Note that directly accessing a singleton instead\\nof using an instance variable is deﬁnitively not a good design since it\\nfavors procedural-like global access over encapsulation and distribution\\nof knowledge.

The singleton design pattern looks trivial but it is often\\nmisunderstood: it should be used when you want to ensure that there is\\nnever more than one instance; it does notlimit access to one instance at a\\ntime. In general, if you can avoid a singleton by adding an instance variable\\nto an object, then you do not need the singleton.Note\\nThe method renderContentOn: is called by Seaside to render a component.

Note that in one case we use a normal submitButton , and in\\nthe other case we use cancelButton .\\nPay attention since the cancel button looks exactly the same as a submit\\nbutton, but it avoids processing the input callbacks of the form that would\\nmodify our model.

Replacing a copied object works well in our example,\\nbut does not if there are other references to the object (because you end\\nup with a new object).

As soon as the changes are saved, it walks over the Memento\\nand pushes the changes to the real object.Advanced\\n15.8 Embedding Child Components\\nSo far, we have seen how a component displays itself and how a component\\ncan invoke another one. This component invocation has behaved like a modal\\ninterface in which you can interact only with one dialog at a time. Now,\\nwe will demonstrate the real power of Seaside: creating an application by\\nsimply plugging together components which may have been independently\\ndeveloped. How do we get several components to display on the same page?\\nBy simply having a component identify its subcomponents. This is done by\\nimplementing the children method.\\nSuppose that we would like to add an item to our list.

By “static”\\nwe mean resources whose contents are not sensitive to the context in which\\nthey are used. These resources are not dependent on the user or session state\\nand while they may change from time to time they typically don’t change\\nduring the time span of a single user’s session. Static resources include for\\nexample images, style sheets and JavaScript ﬁles.\\nUsing these resources in a Seaside application need be no different from using\\nthem in any other web application development framework: when deploy-\\ning your application you can serve these resources using a web server and\\nreference them in your Seaside application, as described in Chapter 23.\\nIn addition, Seaside supports a more tightly integrated ﬁle serving technique,\\ncalled FileLibrary , which has some advantages over using a separate web\\nserver. In this chapter we will cover how to reference external resources\\nand how to use the integrated FileLibrary to serve them from your Smalltalk\\nimage. Note that using FileLibrary to serve static resources is often slower\\nthan using a dedicated web server. In Chapter 23 we explain how to serve\\nstatic ﬁles in a more efﬁcient way using Apache.\\n17.1 Images\\nWe illustrate the inclusion of static resources by displaying an external picture\\nwithin an otherwise empty component.

With web-development\\nyou will sooner or later be bitten by character encoding bugs, no matter how\\nyou try to escape them. As soon as you are getting inputs from the user and\\ndisplaying information in your web-browser, you will be confronted with\\ncharacter encoding problems. However, the basic concepts are simple to\\nunderstand and the difﬁculty often lies in the extra layers that typically a web\\ndeveloper does not have to worry about such as the web-rendering engine,\\nthe web server and the input keyboard.\\nHistorically the difference between character sets and character encoding\\nwas minor, since a standard speciﬁed what characters were available as\\nwell as how they encoded. Unicode and ISO 10646 (Universal Character\\nSet) changed this situation by clearly separating the two concepts. Such a\\nseparation is essential: on one hand you have the character sets you can ma-\\nnipulate and on the other hand you have how they are represented physically\\n(encoded).\\nIn this section we’ll present the two basic concepts you have to understand\\n-character sets and character encodings . This should help you avoid most\\nproblems. Then we will tell you how these are supported in Seaside.\\n17.6.1 Character sets\\nA character set is really just that, a set of characters. These are the characters\\nof your alphabet. For practical reasons each character is identiﬁed by a code\\npoint e.g. $A is identiﬁed by the code point 65.\\nExamples of character sets are ASCII, ISO-8859-1, Unicode or UCS (Universal\\nCharacter Set).\\n•ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) con-\\ntains 128 characters. It was designed following several constraints\\nsuch that it would be easy to go from a lowercase character to', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 245}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='17.6. A WORD ABOUT CHARACTER ENCODINGS 235\\nits uppercase equivalent. You can get the list of characters at\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org /wiki/Ascii. ASCII was designed with the idea\\nin mind that other countries could plug their speciﬁc characters in it\\nbut it somehow failed. ASCII was extended in Extended ASCII which\\noffers 256 characters.\\n•ISO-8859-1 (ISO/IEC 8859-1) is a superset of ASCII to which it\\nadds 128 new characters. Also called Latin-1 orlatin1 , it is the\\nstandard alphabet of the latin alphabet, and is well-suited for Western\\nEurope, Americas, parts of Africa. Since ISO-8859-1 did not con-\\ntain certain characters such as the Euro sign, it was updated into\\nISO-8859-15. However, ISO-8859-1 is still the default encoding of docu-\\nments delivered via HTTP with a MIME type beginning with \"text /\".\\nhttp://www.utoronto.ca /webdocs /HTMLdocs /NewHTML /iso_table.html\\nshows in particular ISO-8859-1.\\n•Unicode is a superset of Latin-1. To accelerate the early adoption of Uni-\\ncode, the ﬁrst 256 code points are identical to ISO-8859-1. A character\\nis not described via its glyph but identiﬁed by its code point, which is\\nusually referred to using \"U+\" followed by its hexadecimal value. Note\\nthat Unicode also speciﬁes a set of rules for normalization, collation\\nbi-directional display order and much more.\\n•UCS – the ‘Universal Character Set’ speciﬁed by the ISO /IEC 10646\\nInternational Standard contains a hundred thousand characters. Each\\ncharacter is unambiguously identiﬁed by a name and an integer also\\ncalled its code point.\\nhttp://www.ﬁleformat.info /info/charset /index.htm shows several character\\nsets.\\nFigure 17.11: The Pharo String Hierarchy.\\nIn Pharo. Now let us see the concepts exist in Pharo. The String , ByteString ,\\nWideString class hierarchy is roughly equivalent to the Integer , SmallInteger ,\\nLargeInteger hierarchy. The class Integer is the abstract superclass of\\nSmallInteger which represents number with ranges between -1073741824\\nand 1073741823, and LargeInteger which represents all the other numbers.\\nIn Pharo, the class String is the abstract superclass of the classes ByteString', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 246}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='236 CHAPTER 17. SERVING FILES\\n(ISO-8859-1) and WideString (Unicode minus ISO-8859-1). Such classes are\\nabout character sets and not encodings.\\n17.6.2 Encodings\\nAn encoding is a mapping between a character (or its code point) and a\\nsequence of bytes, and vice versa.\\nSimple Mappings. The mapping can be a one-to-one mapping between the\\ncharacter and the byte that represents it. If and only if your character set has\\n255 or less entries you can directly map each character by its index to a single\\nbyte. This is the case for ASCII and ISO-8859-1.\\nIn the latest version of Pharo, the Character class represents a character by\\nstoring its Unicode. Since Unicode is a superset of latin1, you can create latin1\\nstrings by specifying their direct values. When a String is composed only of\\nASCII or latin1 characters, it is encoded in a ByteString (a collection of bytes\\neach one representing a character).\\n(String with: (Character value: 65) with: (Character value: 66)).\\n\"-> \\' AB \\' \"\\n\\' AB \\' class.\\n\"-> ByteString\"\\n(String with: (Character value: 16r5B) with: (Character value: 16r5D)).\\n\"-> \\' [] \\' \"\\n(String with: (Character value: 16rA9)).\\n\"-> the copyright character &copy;\"\\nCharacter value: 16rFC.\\n\"-> the u-umlaut character &uuml;\"\\nThe characters Character value: 16r5B ( [) and Character value: 65 ( A) are\\nboth available in ASCII and ISO-8859-1. Now Character value: 16rA9 dis-\\nplays &copy; the copyright sign which is only available in ISO-8859-1, simi-\\nlarly Character value: 16rFC displays &uuml;.\\nOther Mappings. As we already mentioned Unicode is a large superset of\\nLatin-1 with over hundred thousand of characters. Unicode cannot simply be\\nencoded on a single byte. There exist several character encodings for Unicode:\\nthe Unicode Transformation Format (UTF) encodings, and the Universal\\nCharacter Set (UCS) encodings.\\nThe number in the encodings name indicates the number of bits in one\\ncode point (for UTF encodings) or the number of bytes per code point (for', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 247}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='17.6. A WORD ABOUT CHARACTER ENCODINGS 237\\nUCS) encodings. UTF-8 and UTF-16 are probably the most commonly used\\nencodings. UCS-2 is an obsolete subset of UTF-16; UCS-4 and UTF-32 are\\nfunctionally equivalent.\\n•UTF-8 (8-bits UCS /Unicode Transformation Format) is a variable length\\ncharacter encoding for Unicode. The Dollar Sign ( $) is Unicode U+0024.\\nUTF-8 is able to represent any character of the Unicode character sets,\\nbut it is backwards compatible with ASCII. It uses 1 byte for all ASCII\\ncharacters, which have the same code values as in the standard ASCII\\nencoding, and up to 4 bytes for other characters.\\n•UCS-2 which is now obsolete used 2 bytes for all the characters but it\\ncould not encode all the Unicode standard.\\n•UTF-16 extends UCS-2 to encode character missing from UCS-2. It is\\na variable size encoding using two bytes in most cases. There are two\\nvariants – the little endian and big endian versions: 16rFC 16r00 16r00\\n16rFC are variant representations of the same encoded character.\\nIf you want to know more on character sets and character encodings, we\\nsuggest you read the Unicode Standard book, currently describing the version\\n5.0.\\n17.6.3 In Seaside and Pharo\\nNow let us see how these principles apply to Pharo. The Unicode introduction\\nstarted with version 3.8 of Squeak and it is slowly consolidated. You can\\nstill develop applications with different encodings with Seaside. There is\\nan important rule in Seaside about the encoding: “do unto Seaside as you\\nwould have Seaside do unto you”. This means that if you run an encoded\\nadapter web server such as WAKomEncoded , Seaside will give you strings in\\nthe speciﬁed encoding but also expect from you strings in that encoding. In\\nSqueak encoding, each character is represented by an instance of Character . If\\nyou have non-Latin-1 characters, you’ll end up with instances of WideString .\\nIf all your Characters are in Latin-1, you’ll have ByteStrings .\\nWAKomEncoded. WAKomEncoded takes one or more bytes of UTF-8 and maps\\nthem to a single character (and vice versa). This allows it to support all\\n100,000 characters in Unicode. The following code shows how to start the\\nencoding adapter.\\n\"Start on a different port from your standard (WAKom) port\"\\nWAKomEncoded startOn: 8081\\nWAKom. Now what WAKom does, is a one to one mapping from bytes to\\ncharacters.

Examples for such combination\\nare ASCII and ISO-8859-1 (latin-1).\\nIf you run a non-encoded web server adapter like WAKom , Seaside will give\\nyou strings in the encoding of the web page (!) and expect from you strings\\nin the encoding of the web page.\\nExample. If you have the character &auml; in a UTF-8 encoded page and you\\nrun an encoding server adapter like WAKomEncoded this character is represented\\nby the Squeak string:\\nString with: (Character value: 16rE4)\\nHowever if you run an adapter like WAKom , the same character &auml; is repre-\\nsented by the Squeak string:\\nString with: (Character value: 16rC3) with: (Character value: 16rA4).\\nYes, that is a string with two Characters! How can this be? Because &auml;\\n(the Unicode character U+00E4) is encoded in UTF-8 with the two byte se-\\nquence 0xC3 0xA4 and WAKom does not interpret that, it just serves the two\\nbytes.\\nUse UTF-8. Try to use UTF-8 for your external encodings because it\\nsupports Unicode. So you can have access to the largest character set.\\nThen use WAKomEncoded ; this way your internal string will be encoded on\\nWideString. WAKomEncoded will do the conversion of the response /answer\\nbetween WideString and UTF-8.Important\\nTo see if your encoding works, go to http: //localhost:8080 /tests/alltests and\\nthen to the “Encoding” test (select WAEncodingTest ).

So now that you decided which encoding\\nto use and that Seaside will send pages to the browser in that encoding, you\\nwill have to tell the browser which encoding you decided to use.

It is about supporting standard protocols and allowing your\\napplication to run on many different devices, not just a web browser on a\\ndesktop computer. It is about letting your users interact with each other. It\\nis about letting your application evolve with the needs of your users. That’s\\nwhy many Web 2.0 projects are constantly evolving.\\nIn this chapter we will present the different solutions offered by Seaside\\nto support Web 2.0. We will extend the todo application we built in Chap-\\nter 15 with Web 2.0 technology. The deﬁnition of Web 2.0 itself is still open.\\nEvery day there are new features popping up, calling themselves the new\\nleader in the Web 2.0 movement. Seaside is very supportive of the Web 2.0\\nphilosophy.\\n•Seaside ensures that the XHTML it produces is valid. It encourages\\ndevelopers to use meaningful XHTML markup and frees them from\\nworrying about the ﬁnal look of the application. Seaside lets designers\\ndeﬁne the colors, fonts and layout of the page through Cascading Style\\nSheets (CSS) as shown in Chapter 8.\\n•Seaside embraces the evolution of web applications. In contrast to ﬁle-\\nbased web frameworks, Seaside allows one to take advantage of the full\\npower of the Smalltalk development environment. The ability to refac-\\ntor, test and navigate an application with the same set of tools makes\\nit extremely powerful and easy to change and adapt the application to\\nnew needs. On-the-ﬂy debugging is a huge time saver.\\n•Seaside integrates easily with other output formats. Microformats are\\nthe easiest way to go. Just add speciﬁc classes and attributes to your\\nXHTML to make your application generate a valid microformat. In\\nChapter 19 we demonstrate how to add an RSS (Really Simple Syndica-\\ntion) stream of todo items to your users.\\n•While the core of Seaside does not rely on JavaScript, this client side\\ntechnology might help you to increase the appeal and the usability\\nof your web application. AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)\\nenables you to build user interactions without having to reload the\\nwhole page with every click. Best of all, the application will feel much\\nmore responsive. In Chapter 20 and Chapter 21 we will learn how to\\nextend the todo application by communicating asynchronously with\\nthe server and adding JavaScript gimmicks without writing a single\\nline of JavaScript code.\\n•Comet takes AJAX to the next level. While traditional web servers\\nalways wait for the client to request data, Comet allows you to actively\\npush changes from the server to the client. In Chapter 22 we will use\\nthis technology to let other people observe how our todo list updates.', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 266}),\n",

DYNAMIC CONTENT WITH SCRIPTACULOUS\\n20.1 Prototype and script.aculo.us\\nPrototype (http: //www.prototypejs.org) is a free, open-source JavaScript\\nframework, that aims to ease JavaScript programming. The framework was\\ncreated by Sam Stephenson and enhances the JavaScript experience with utili-\\nties to perform AJAX requests and to do DOM manipulations without having\\nto worry about web browser incompatibilities. Although the framework\\nis called Prototype (a reference to JavaScript’s prototype-based inheritance\\nmodel), it implements its features in a traditional class-based model.\\nMany of Prototype’s extensions to JavaScript are inspired by Smalltalk and\\nRuby. For example, after loading the Prototype library, a JavaScript Array is\\nextended with methods that have familiar Smalltalk names: select , reject ,\\ncollect , and detect . Up until recently, these similarities make Prototype the\\nframework of choice to integrate with Seaside and Smalltalk. Nowadays the\\nJQuery (http: //www.jquery.com /) framework described in Chapter 21 is a\\nnice alternative to the Prototype library.\\nThe Prototype framework aims to make JavaScript programming simpler, and\\nit does not have any features to make the user interface richer. script.aculo.us\\n(http: //script.aculo.us) is a free, open-source JavaScript framework, built on\\ntop of Prototype, providing visual effects, drag and drop and several ready-\\nmade user interface controls. The author of script.aculo.us Thomas Fuchs\\nsummarizes: “It’s about the user interface, baby!”\\nSeaside provides a complete integration of Prototype and script.aculo.us\\ncalled “Scriptaculous”. This means that you can access all aspects of these\\nframeworks from Smalltalk by writing Smalltalk code only. Every JavaScript\\nclass has a counterpart in the Smalltalk world and can be used without\\nhaving to know the details of the underlying JavaScript implementation.\\nThe key feature is that Scriptaculous lets you write Smalltalk code that will\\ngenerate JavaScript snippets embedded in the XHTML stream created by\\nSeaside.\\n20.1.1 Installation\\nAs a ﬁrst step we need to make sure that the Smalltalk Scriptaculous package\\nis loaded. Most prebuilt images such as the one-click image already come\\nwith this package included. Note that despite the Scriptaculous name, the\\npackage includes the JavaScript source and integration code for both the\\nPrototype and the script.aculo.us frameworks.\\nMake sure to have the packages Javascript-Core , Prototype-Core ,\\nScriptaculous-Core and Scriptaculous-Components loaded.

DYNAMIC CONTENT WITH SCRIPTACULOUS\\n20.2.2 Using a Brush\\nUnlike a normal XHTML brush, we have to explicitly add the JavaScript\\nsnippet to the XHTML output stream. There are essentially four different\\nplaces a JavaScript snippet can be added: (1) right at the current position in\\nthe XHTML output stream into a script tag, (2) into a method that will be\\nautomatically evaluated when the page has completely loaded, (3) to a DOM\\nelement, or (4) as an event handler to a DOM element.\\n1. Adding to a script tag. You can add the brush right at the current place\\ninto the XHTML output stream. This is done by creating a script tag using an\\nexpression such as html script: aJavaScriptBrush . This technique is simple\\nand straightforward, however it has the disadvantage that the JavaScript\\ncode will be evaluated right away when the web browser parses the ﬁle.\\nThis might happen even before the whole page is read in the web browser\\nand might cause JavaScript errors, as there are no guarantees that the DOM\\nelements you use are already available. In most cases this is not the preferred\\nway to go.\\n2. Adding to a list of load-scripts. You can add the brush to a list of load\\nscripts. These load scripts will be evaluated after the page has ﬁnished load-\\ning. This solution is usually preferred over the previous one. The following\\nexpression is an example:\\nhtml document addLoadScript: aJavaScriptBrush\\n3. Adding to a DOM element. Often JavaScript brushes need to know the\\nID of the element they are supposed to operate on. For example if we want to\\napply an effect to an element we need to pass the ID of that particular element\\nto the JavaScript brush. Luckily there is an easy way to do this automatically\\nand at the same time add the JavaScript brush to the list of load scripts.

This makes it easier for us to change its\\nbehavior.\\n•In renderHeadingOn: we ﬁrst ask Seaside to generate a new unique ID.\\nIn this case it would be possible to use our own ID string, however\\nthis is considered bad practice. If you want to use the component in a\\ndifferent context, the ID might conﬂict with existing code. Also when\\nhardcoding IDs it is, for exactly the same reason, not possible to have\\ntwo instances of the same component visible on a page. We also add\\nsome class information to the heading tag, to allow our CSS to cause\\nthe cursor to change when the mouse moves over the heading.\\n•Next we create an effect called SUEffect >> toggleAppear and assign it\\nto the onclick event of the heading. Since we don’t want to toggle the\\nappearance of the heading itself (which would be the default), we pass\\nit the generated ID. Two other interesting toggle-effects we could have\\nused are SUEffect >> toggleBlind and SUEffect >> toggleSlide .\\n•Last but not least we add the div element we would like to toggle on and\\noff. Obviously this is the element with our automatically generated ID,\\nso we assign it here. Since the div element should not be visible in the\\nbeginning we hide it with an inline style. Moreover we assign the CSS\\nclass help , so that we are able to change its look from the style-sheet.\\nIf we have a look at the running ToDo application, it works as proposed.\\nHowever there is one thing we might want to improve: whenever we have\\na full refresh, for example when clicking on a link or button, the help text\\ndisappears again. The reason is that we only speciﬁed client side behavior:\\nwhenever the heading is clicked the JavaScript code is executed that has been\\ngenerated by Seaside. And the JavaScript code doesn’t talk back to the server,\\nit just toggles the visibility of a DOM node on the client.

       " Document(page_content='274 CHAPTER 20. DYNAMIC CONTENT WITH SCRIPTACULOUS\\n20.4 AJAX: Talking back to the Server\\nAJAX is an acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML . The fact that it\\nis asynchronous means that additional data is passed to, or requested from\\nthe web server in the background, without the user waiting for it to arrive.\\nJavaScript obviously names the programming language that is used to trig-\\nger the request. Fortunately the data being transmitted by an AJAX request\\ndoesn’t have to be in XML. It can be anything that can be sent through the\\nHTTP protocol. The reason for the “XML” in the name is that in most web\\nbrowsers the internal implementation of this functionality can be found in an\\nobject called XMLHttpRequest . Thankfully the Prototype framework and its in-\\ntegration into Seaside makes it a cakewalk to use in your applications.\\n20.4.1 Deﬁning a Callback\\nOur goal is to get notiﬁed whenever the heading is clicked. We add html\\nrequest callback: aBlock to the click handler, where aBlock is a Seaside\\ncallback block, like the one we use for an anchor. We add the snippet as\\nanother click handler to the heading and add an instance variable to remember\\nthe visibility of our help text.

When we\\ntry the application it is actually quite hard to see that it works any differently\\nthan before; certainly for the end user it looks exactly the same as before.\\nBehind the scenes it’s a different story: in the background our additional\\nJavaScript code triggers a request that goes to the server and evaluates our\\ncallback block. You can put a logging statement Transcript show: visible;\\ncror a self halt into that block to see that it really evaluates the code.\\nAnother very useful tool to observe how AJAX requests are passed between\\nyour web browser and Seaside is Firebug, a Firefox extension. We will have a\\nlook at this tool in the next section in great detail.\\n20.4.2 Serializing a Form\\nAn annoying behavior of our application is that the user has to click save\\nto submit changes in the todo list. This is not really user-friendly and also\\ndangerous, because it is too easy to forget to hit the save button after toggling\\nthe checkboxes. With AJAX we can improve this, and let the browser worry\\nabout saving our changes. Let’s use AJAX to automatically submit the form\\nwhenever a checkbox is clicked:\\nToDoListView>>renderItem: anItem on: html\\nhtml listItem\\nclass: \\' done \\' if: anItem isDone;\\nclass: \\' overdue \\' if: anItem isOverdue;\\nwith: [\\nhtml checkbox\\nonChange: (html scriptaculous request \"<-- added \"\\ntriggerForm: (html scriptaculous element up: \\' form \\' ));\\nvalue: anItem done;\\ncallback: [ :value | anItem done: value ].\\nhtml text: anItem title.\\nhtml space.\\nhtml anchor\\ncallback: [ self edit: anItem ];\\nwith: \\' edit \\' .\\nhtml space.\\nhtml anchor\\ncallback: [ self remove: anItem ];\\nwith: \\' remove \\' ]', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 286}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='276 CHAPTER 20. DYNAMIC CONTENT WITH SCRIPTACULOUS\\nOnce you’ve made this change, load the application in your browser and\\nclick on one of the checkboxes. Without pressing save, refresh your browser\\nwindow, and you should see the new value has ‘stuck’.\\nAgain we are using the request object, but this time instead of a callback we\\ntell it to trigger a form using PTAjax >> triggerForm: . This method expects a\\nDOM ID or DOM node of a form as an argument. We could use the same\\ntrick that we used previously and let Seaside generate a unique ID and\\nassign it to the form and to our JavaScript snippet. This technique has the\\ndisadvantage that we introduce a new dependency between the method that\\nrenders the form and the one that renders the checkbox, which might not be\\ndesired.\\nhtml scriptaculous element up: \\' form \\'\\nwalks up the DOM tree and returns the ﬁrst form it encounters. In our case\\nthis is the surrounding form of our checkbox. The starting point of this lookup\\nis the current DOM node (our checkbox) since we didn’t specify a different\\nelement using PTElement >> id:. If we only used PTElement >> up, we would\\nhave got the parent element of the checkbox, which in this example is the div\\nelement. There are some other methods deﬁned in PTElement that navigate\\nthe DOM tree in other directions: PTElement >> down, PTElement >> next, and\\nPTElement >> previous .\\nSerializing your data. Once the form element has been found in the DOM,\\nwe then want to specify what to do with it:\\nhtml request\\ntriggerForm: (html element up: \\' form \\' )\\nHere, the triggerForm: says we want the page to ‘serialize’ the form, that is,\\nto convert the DOM representation of the form (and all its included ﬁelds)\\ninto a string that can be passed back to the server when required. We pass this\\nserialised version into the request method of the html object, which causes the\\nrequired JavaScript code to be generated in the page in your browser.\\nBecause all of this happens as an argument to html checkbox onChange: , the\\nscript will be generated into the onchange attribute of the checkbox, giving\\nyou something like the following:\\n<input class=\"checkbox\" type=\"checkbox\" name=\"4\" checked=\"checked\"\\nonchange=\"new Ajax.Request(\\n\\' http://localhost:8080/todo \\' ,\\n{ \\' parameters \\' :[ \\' 3 \\' ,$($(this).up( \\' form \\' )).serialize()].join( \\' & \\' )})\"/>\\nSo the effect of this code is that when you click on the checkbox, its onchange\\nevent gets ﬁred. This creates an Ajax request that is sent back to your server\\nwith your serialized form.

Since we\\nstill have the button, our application can be used with and without JavaScript\\nsupport.\\n20.4.3 Updating XHTML\\nThe most important feature of AJAX is the ability to update parts of a page,\\nwithout having the browser request and parse a whole new page from scratch.\\nThis is important since in most web applications only small parts of a page\\nchange with each user interaction.\\nIf you look carefully at your todo list page in the browser, you’ll notice that the\\ncolour of your todo items doesn’t change when you mark them as completed.\\nIt would be nice if we could change the colour of a todo item depending on\\nits state and give the user visual feedback.

Since we still want\\nthe server to process the changes to the form, we keep the line that triggers\\nthe form. To allow the update to happen, we need to give the updater two\\nnew pieces of information.\\nFirst, we pass the ID of the DOM element that we want it to update. When\\nthe update happens, that whole section of your page will be removed, and\\nreplaced by some new content that you must specify.\\nSecond, in order to specify the new content, we create a callback block which\\nwill be triggered to render. Notice that we pass a new renderer ajaxHtml to\\nthe callback block; the block uses this renderer to render the list of items. Also\\nnotice that the checkbox has two callbacks now: one responsible for the state\\nof the checkbox, the other one responsible to update the HTML.\\nIt is important that you use only the renderer passed as argument to the\\nAJAX callback block.

Below you see a\\nsequence diagram of the interaction between the web browser and the server\\nduring an AJAX updater action.\\nFigure 20.3: A full request (1) and an AJAX request (2) updating part of the\\npage.\\n1. Full Request. Every web application, even a completely AJAX driven\\none, starts out with a full request. The web browser sends off a request to\\nthe desired URL, in our case / todo. The request is processed by the web\\nserver and passed to the Seaside dispatcher, which passes it on to the correct\\nsession and triggers the components to render. Eventually Seaside calls\\nreturnResponse: that returns the fully rendered page back to the web browser.\\nAs soon as the web browser receives the response it starts to parse the XHTML.\\nDuring the parsing the browser may load some additional resources such as\\nimages, style-sheets or JavaScript ﬁles, and eventually displays the result to\\nthe user.\\n2. AJAX Request.

It is important to note that this request\\nis made asynchronously (note the different arrow in the diagram), so\\nthe web browser remains fully functional while the AJAX request is\\nprocessed by the server. Also note, that this means the JavaScript\\nstatement following the AJAX updater is immediately executed. The\\nJavaScript engine does not block until the server returns a response.\\n2.Similar to the full request, Seaside receives the request and determines\\nthe correct session to handle it. Instead of calling renderContentOn: of\\nthe root page to generate a complete XHTML page, Seaside evaluates\\nthe callback block. In our case the callback block sends the message\\nrenderItemsOn: , that renders the list of todo items. The partial response\\nis then passed back to the web browser using returnResponse: .\\n3.Finally the JavaScript engine gets notiﬁed that a response is ready to\\nbe processed (remember, the request was sent asynchronously). The\\nXHTML snippet is parsed and inserted at a speciﬁc location in the DOM\\ntree.\\nSo far we only had a look at the AJAX requestor and updater . The requestor\\nis used to serialize forms and trigger events on the server. The updater goes\\none step further. It allows one to update a speciﬁed DOM node with newly\\nrendered content. There are two powerful AJAX features that we are going to\\nlook at now, the periodical updater and the evaluator .\\nPeriodical Updater. The periodical updater PTPeriodical is an updater that\\nperiodically performs a normal AJAX update action. This is commonly used\\nby all sorts of polling mechanisms. Note that in Chapter 22 we will have a\\nlook at a different way to continuously update contents on a web page, that\\ndoesn’t use polling. We can add the following code snippet to any application\\nto continuously display the current time:\\nhtml div\\nscript: (html scriptaculous periodical\\nfrequency: 1 second;\\ncallback: [ :ajaxHtml | ajaxHtml render: Time now ]);\\nwith: Time now\\nNote that in this example we don’t need to specify an ID, since we assign the\\nscript directly to a DOM element. In this case Seaside automatically connects\\nthe updater with the owning XHTML element. If we wanted to update a\\ndifferent DOM element, we would have to specify the ID of this element\\nusing id:. We set the update frequency to every second. This is more a period\\nthan a frequency, but that’s what it is called in the Prototype framework.\\nThe callback block is then evaluated every second and renders the current\\ntime.\\nEvaluator. The evaluator PTEvaluator is the most complicated, but also most\\npowerful AJAX mechanism.

This is extremely\\npowerful and allows one to update multiple DOM elements and play effects\\nin one request. Again the evaluator looks very similar to the normal updater,\\nbut instead of passing a XHTML canvas into the callback block it gives you a\\nscript object where you insert JavaScript snippets. To see some sophisticated\\nexamples of its use have a look at SUTabPanel or SUAccordion that come with\\nthe Scriptaculous package. Both widgets update multiple parts of the page\\nand change several CSS classes of the widget at the same time.\\n20.4.5 Wrap Up\\nBefore using AJAX you have to make several decisions. First you must decide\\nwhich AJAX strategy you want to use.\\n• PTFactory >> request – The requestor does not send anything back to\\nthe client. It solely sends a request and pushes data to the server.\\n• PTFactory >> updater – The updater updates a single part of the page.\\nYou need to provide the ID of the DOM element to update and a callback\\nblock that expects one parameter to render the partial XHTML on.\\n• PTFactory >> periodical – The periodical updater is an updater that is\\nperiodically executed. Additionally you need to specify an update\\nfrequency.\\n• PTFactory >> evaluator – The evaluator injects new JavaScript code into\\nthe web browser. Its callback block expects one parameter that will\\naccept new JavaScript snippets.\\nAfter having chosen the AJAX strategy you might want to specify additional\\noptions and declare state that should be transmitted to the server. The most\\ncommon ones are:\\n• PTAjax >> triggerForm: – Serialize a complete form and trigger all its\\nassociated callbacks. Note that the callbacks of submit buttons are\\nignored to preserve consistency, use the callback to trigger speciﬁc code\\nevaluation.\\n• PTAjax >> triggerFormElement: – Serialize a form ”element” such as a\\ntext input ﬁeld and triggers its associated callback. Note that this does\\nnot work for all form elements. For example, check-boxes depend\\ninternally on other hidden form elements. Submit-button callbacks are\\nignored.\\n• PTAjax >> callback:value: – Serialize the result of evaluating the value\\nas a JavaScript expression on the client and pass it as an argument into\\nthe callback block.', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 292}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='282 CHAPTER 20. DYNAMIC CONTENT WITH SCRIPTACULOUS\\nFurthermore you might want to register some events to get notiﬁed about the\\nstate of the AJAX action. The most common events are listed below.\\n• PTAjax >> onSuccess: – Invoked when a request completes and its status\\ncode is undeﬁned or belongs to the 200 family.\\n• PTAjax >> onFailure: – Invoked when a request completes and its status\\ncode exists but is not in the 200 family.\\n• PTAjax >> onComplete: – Invoked at the very end of a request’s life-cycle,\\nonce the request completed, status-speciﬁc callbacks were called, and\\npossible automatic behaviors were processed.\\nThe above events and some other AJAX options can also be globally set using\\nPTResponders . This is useful to deﬁne an error handler once for the whole\\npage in case the session expires. The following code snipped displays an\\nerror message and triggers a full refresh whenever that happens:\\nhtml document\\naddLoadScript: (html prototype responders\\nonFailure: (html javascript alert: \\' Session Expired \\' ) ,\\n(html javascript refresh))\\n20.5 Drag and Drop\\nThe script.aculo.us library comes with sophisticated support for drag and\\ndrop. You can deﬁne DOM elements to be draggable and (other) DOM\\nelements to accept drags. script.aculo.us provides a something called sortables\\nwhich are very easy to use. They enable you to specify XHTML elements\\nwhose children can be sorted. As seen in the ﬁgure below, we are going to\\nuse sortables to enable end-users to reorder their todo items.\\nTo implement sortable todo items we need to change two parts of the appli-\\ncation.

While viewing the todo application, open the Firebug\\nconsole. There are two ways to do this: by clicking on Tools>Firebug >Open\\nFirebug ; or by clicking on the Firebug icon on the status bar – this will be a\\ngreen checkmark or a ‘bug’ icon depending on your version of Firebug.

This may prompt you to enable it before\\nproceeding; if this is the case, you should also reload your page. Now click in\\nthe todo application on the checkboxes, and observe how the asynchronous\\nrequests are logged in the console. By clicking on the log entries you can\\nfurther inspect the header ﬁelds, and the contents of the request and response\\nobjects. Note that this tool is indispensable for observing how AJAX requests\\nare sent, since there is no other way to observe it on the client side.\\nAnother interesting feature of the console is the ability to display custom\\ninformation. For example you can temporarily replace the code that renders\\nthe checkbox with the following code:\\nhtml checkbox\\nonChange:\\n(html logger info: ' Before AJAX ' ),\\n(html updater\\nid: listId;\\ntriggerForm: (html element up: ' form ' );\\ncallback: [ :ajaxHtml | self renderItemsOn: ajaxHtml ];\\nonComplete: (html logger warn: ' After Update ' )) ,\\n(html logger error: ' After AJAX ' );\\nvalue: anItem done;\\ncallback: [ :value | anItem done: value ].\\nNote that we are using the ,operator to concatenate multiple script snip-\\npets. Of course this also works with other JavaScript snippets, not just with\\nlogging statements. So we display the strings Before AJAX and After AJAX\\nright before and after the updater is executed. Furthermore we added an-\\nother logging statement to the onComplete: event handler of the updater.\\nClicking on a checkbox produces the 3 logging statements in the sequence\\nyou see below.

The web server just waits at the other\\nend and processes whatever requests it receives. For many applications it\\nwould be beneﬁcial if the server could propagate events to the clients as they\\nhappen. For example a chat application would like to push new messages to\\nall connected users, or our todo application would like to push updates of\\nthe model to other people working on the same list.\\nEven today, the most common solution to this problem is to use polling. That\\nis, the client regularly queries the server for new information. The only way\\nto decrease the latency is to increase the polling frequency, which causes a\\nsigniﬁcant load on the server. In practice one would like to avoid both a high\\nserver load and high latency.\\nIn March 2006 Alex Russell coined the term Comet in a blog post to describe an\\nalternative approach: one where the server keeps its connection to the client\\nopen, and continues to send updates to the client through that connection.\\nThe idea that Alex describes in Comet was previously known by a variety of\\nterms like ‘reverse AJAX’, ‘HTTP push’, ‘server streaming’, etc, but Alex’ post\\npopularised the concept.\\nComet was incorporated into Seaside only a few months after it was intro-\\nduced.\\n22.1 Inside Comet\\nBefore we dive into a comet application, let us have a look at precisely how\\nComet works.

The ﬁrst round-trip between\\nthe web browser and Seaside is a normal HTTP request that returns a full\\nXHTML page. This ﬁrst page includes a small JavaScript snippet, that is\\nexecuted once the page has ﬁnished loading. This starts a new asynchronous\\nconnection to the server. This connection now persists for a much longer time,\\nessentially as long as the web browser is listening. This connection can then\\nbe used by the server to send data to the web browser at any time.\\nFigure 22.1: Comet enables the server to push data to the client, without that\\nthe client has to poll the server for fresh content.\\nWhen using Comet, keep in mind that HTTP was not designed to push data\\nfrom the server to the client. Comet is a hack, even if the details are hidden\\nin Seaside. Luckily the implementation works on all modern web browsers,\\nbut there is no guarantee that these tricks will continue to work with the next\\ngeneration of web browsers. It should be noted that upcoming generations of\\nweb browsers will very likely support this type of inverse communication,\\nand there is work on an emerging Comet standard.\\nEnough ranting, let’s give it a quick try.\\n22.2 Getting Started\\nThe Seaside Comet functionality comes packaged in the package named\\nComet.

What does Streaming-server required\\nmean? On most Smalltalk platforms Seaside does not stream responses by\\ndefault.

Obviously this does not work for Comet, since\\nwe need to continually send data to the client.\\nThe default server adapter on Squeak does not support streaming and nei-\\nther does Swazoo.

This can be done\\nthrough the registrar of the domain name. The Seaside application is now\\nreachable through seasidehosting.st and your own personal domain.\\nAn annoyance of Seaside-Hosting is that whenever you want to update your\\nweb-application you need to upload an image. This is especially an issue if\\nyou have a slow internet connection and your images are relatively big. To\\navoid this issue you might want to look at the class WAVersionUploader that\\nis normally installed at / tools/ versionuploader . It is a simple web interface\\nto the Monticello versioning system and allows one to remotely update and\\nload packages into a running image. Try it out locally ﬁrst, to see if it suits\\nyour needs. Again, make sure to password protect the application, if you\\nplan to use it in a public deployment.\\n23.3 Deployment with Apache\\nIn this section we discuss a typical server setup for Seaside using Debian\\nLinux as operating system. Even if you are not on a Unix system, you might\\nwant to continue reading, as the basic principles are the same everywhere.\\nDue to the deviation of different Linux and Apache distributions, the instruc-\\ntions given here cannot replace the documentation for your particular target\\nsystem.\\n23.3.1 Preparing the Server\\nBefore getting started you need a server machine. This is a computer with a\\nstatic IP address that is always connected to the Internet. It is not required\\nthat you have physical access to your machine. You might well decide to host\\nyour application on a virtual private server (VPS). It is important to note that\\nyou require superuser-level access to be able to run Smalltalk images. The\\nability to execute PHP scripts is not enough.\\nWe assume that your server already has a working Linux installation. In the\\nfollowing sections we use Debian Linux 5.0 (Lenny), however with minor\\nadjustments you will also be able to deploy applications on other distribu-\\ntions.', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 336}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='326 CHAPTER 23. DEPLOYMENT\\nBefore starting with the setup of your application, it is important to make\\nsure that your server software is up-to-date. It is crucial that you always\\nkeep your server up to the latest version to prevent malicious attacks and\\nwell-known bugs in the software.\\nTo update your server execute the following commands from a terminal. Most\\ncommands we use in this chapter require administrative privileges, therefore\\nwe prepend them with sudo (super user do):\\n$ sudo apt-get update\\n$ sudo apt-get upgrade\\nReading package lists... Done\\nBuilding dependency tree... Done\\n0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.\\n23.3.2 Installing Apache\\nNext we install Apache 2.2, an industry leading open-source web server.\\nDepending on your requirements you might decide to install a different web\\nserver. Lighttpd, for example, might be better suited in a high performance\\nenvironment.\\nSome people prefer to use one of the web servers written in Smalltalk. This\\nis a good choice during development and prototyping, as such a server is\\neasy to setup and maintain. We strongly discourage to use such a setup for\\nproduction applications due to the following reasons:\\n•The web server is something accessible from outside the world and\\ntherefore exposed to malicious attacks. Apache is a proven industry\\nstandard used by more than 50% (depending on the survey) of all of\\ntoday’s web sites.\\n•To listen on port 80, the standard port used by the HTTP protocol, the\\nweb server needs to run as root. Running a public service as root is a\\nhuge security issue. Dedicated web servers such as Apache drop their\\nroot privileges after startup. This allows them to listen to port 80 while\\nnot being root. Unfortunately this is not something that can be easily\\ndone from within the Smalltalk VM.\\n•Smalltalk is relatively slow when reading ﬁles and processing large\\namounts of data (the fact that everything is an object is rather a dis-\\nadvantage in this case). A web server running natively on the host\\nplatform is always faster by an order of magnitude. A standalone web\\nserver can take advantages of the underlying operating system and\\nadvise it to directly stream data from the ﬁle-system to the socket as\\nefﬁciently as possible. Furthermore web servers usually provide highly\\nefﬁcient caching strategies.', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 337}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='23.3. DEPLOYMENT WITH APACHE 327\\n•Most of today’s Smalltalk systems (with the exception of GemStone)\\nare single threaded. This means that when your image is serving ﬁles,\\nSeaside is blocked and cannot produce dynamic content at the same\\ntime. On most of today’s multi-core systems you get much better per-\\nformance when serving static ﬁles through Apache running in parallel\\nto your Seaside application server.\\n•External web servers integrate well with the rest of the world. Your web\\napplication might need to integrate into an existing site. Often a web\\nsite consists of static as well as dynamic content provided by different\\ntechnologies. The seamingless integration of all these technologies is\\nsimple with Apache.\\nLet’s go and install Apache then. If you are running an older version you\\nmight want to consider upgrading, as it makes the integration with Seaside\\nconsiderably simpler, although it is not strictly necessary.\\n$ sudo apt-get install apache2\\nEnsure the server is running and make it come up automatically when the\\nmachine boots:\\n$ sudo apache2 -k restart\\n$ sudo update-rc.d apache2 defaults\\n23.3.3 Installing the Squeak VM\\nDepending on the Smalltalk dialect you are using, the installation of the VM\\nis different. Installing Squeak on a Debian system is simple. Install Squeak by\\nentering the following command on the terminal:\\n$ sudo apt-get install squeak-vm\\nNote that installing and running Squeak does not require you to have the\\nX Window System installed. Just tell the installer not to pull these depen-\\ndencies in, when you are asked for it. Squeak remains runnable headless\\nwithout a user-interface, this is what you want to do on most servers any-\\nway. Up-to-date information on the status of the Squeak VM you ﬁnd at\\nhttp://www.squeakvm.org /unix/.\\nNow you should be able to start the VM. Typing the squeak command executes\\na helper script that allows one to install new images and sources in the current\\ndirectory, and run the VM. The VM itself can be started using the squeakvm\\ncommand.\\n$ squeakvm -help\\n$ squeakvm -vm-display-null imagename.image', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 338}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='328 CHAPTER 23. DEPLOYMENT\\nYou can ﬁnd additional help on starting the VM and the possible command\\nline parameters in the man pages:\\n$ man squeak\\nIn the next section we are going to look at how we can run the VM as a\\ndaemon.\\n23.3.4 Running the VMs\\nBefore we hook up the Smalltalk side with the web server, we need a reliable\\nway to start and keep the Smalltalk images running as daemon (background\\nprocess). We have had positive experience using the daemontools , a free\\ncollection of tools for managing UNIX service written by Daniel J. Bernstein.\\nContrary to other tools like inittab , ttys , init.d , or rc.local , the daemontools\\nare reliable and easy to use. Adding a new service means linking a directory\\nwith a script that runs your VM into a centralized place. Removing the service\\nmeans removing the linked directory.\\nType the following command to install daemontools. Please refer to of-\\nﬁcial website (http: //cr.yp.to /daemontools.html) for additional informa-\\ntion.\\n$ apt-get install daemontools-run\\nOn the server create a new folder to carry all the ﬁles of your Seaside appli-\\ncation. We usually put this folder into a subdirectory of / srvand name it\\naccording to our application / srv/ appname , but this is up to you. Copy the\\ndeployment image you prepared in Section 23.1 into that directory. Next we\\ncreate a runscript in the same directory:\\n#!/bin/bash\\n# settings\\nUSER=\"www-data\"\\nVM=\"/usr/bin/squeakvm\"\\nVM_PARAMS=\"-mmap 256m -vm-sound-null -vm-display-null\"\\nIMAGE=\"seaside.image\"\\n# start the vm\\nexec \\\\\\nsetuidgid \"$USER\" \\\\\\n\"$VM\" $VM_PARAMS \"$IMAGE\"\\nAgain, we are using Squeak in this example. You need to check out the\\ndocumentation of your Smalltalk VM, if you are running with a different\\ndialect. Let’s have a quick look at the different parts of the script.', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 339}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='23.3. DEPLOYMENT WITH APACHE 329\\nOn lines 3 to 7 we deﬁne some generic settings. $USER is the user of the\\nsystem that should run your Smalltalk image. If you don’t set a user here,\\nthe web service will run as root, something you must avoid. Make sure\\nyou have the user speciﬁed here on your system. www-data is the default\\nuser for web services on Debian systems. Make sure that this is not a user\\nwith root privileges. $VMdeﬁnes the full path to the Squeak VM. If you have\\na different installation or Smalltalk dialect, you again need to adapt this\\nsetting. $VM_PARAMS deﬁnes the parameters passed to the Squeak VM. If you\\nuse a different environment, you need to consult the documentation and\\nadapt these parameters accordingly. The ﬁrst parameter -mmap 256m limits\\nthe dynamic heap size of the Squeak VM to 256 MB and makes Squeak\\nVMs run more stably. -vm-sound-null disables the sound plugin, something\\nwe certainly don’t need on the server. -vm-display-null makes the VM run\\nheadless. This is crucial on our server, as we presumably don’t have any\\nwindowing server installed.\\nThe last four lines of the script actually start the VM with the given parameters.\\nLine 11 changes the user id of the Squeak VM, and line 12 actually runs the\\nSqueak VM.\\nTo test the script mark it as executable and run it from the command line. You\\nneed to do this as superuser, otherwise you will get an error when trying to\\nchange the user id of the VM.\\n$ chmod +x ./run\\n$ sudo ./run\\nThe VM should be running now. You can verify that by using on of the UNIX\\nconsole tools. In the following example we assume that the image has a web\\nserver installed and is listening on port 8080:\\n$ curl http://localhost:8080\\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\\n\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\"><html\\nxmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" xml:lang=\"en\" lang=\"en\">\\n<head><title>Dispatcher at /</title>\\n...\\nYou might want to change the URL to point to your application.

You may encounter some common problems at\\nthis point. One of these problems is that the VM is unable to ﬁnd or read the\\nimage, change or source ﬁles.

Also ensure that the image has been saved with the\\nweb server running on the correct port.\\nSqueak and Pharo both display an error message when the .changes or\\n.sources ﬁle cannot be found or accessed. Unfortunately this message is\\nnot visible from the console, but only pops up virtually in the headless\\nwindow of the VM. The modal dialog prevents the VM from starting up\\nthe server and thus the image remains unreachable. To solve the problem\\nmake sure that .changes and .sources ﬁles are in the same directory as\\nthe image-ﬁle and that all ﬁles can be read by the user www-data . Another\\npossibility (if you really do not want to distribute the ﬁles) is to disable the\\nmissing ﬁles warning using:Important\\nPreferences disable: #warnIfNoSourcesFile\\nA valuable tool to further troubleshoot a running but otherwise not respond-\\ning VM is lsof , an utility that lists opened ﬁles and sockets by process. You\\ncan install it using apt-get install lsof . Use a different terminal to type the\\nfollowing commands:\\n$ ps -A | grep squeakvm\\n22315 ? 00:17:49 squeakvm\\n$ lsof -p 22315 | grep LISTEN\\nsqueakvm 22315 www-data 7u IPv4 411140468 TCP *:webcache (LISTEN)\\nsqueakvm 22315 www-data 8u IPv4 409571873 TCP *:5900 (LISTEN)\\nWith the ﬁrst line, we ﬁnd out the process id of the running Squeak VM. lsof\\n-p 22315 lists all the open ﬁles and sockets of process 22315 . Since we are\\nonly interested in the sockets Squeak is listening on we grep for the string\\nLISTEN . In this case we see that a web server is correctly listening on port 8080\\n(webcache) and that another service is listening on port 5900. In fact the latter\\nis the RFB server, which we will discuss in Section 23.4.2.\\nIn the original terminal, press Ctrl+C to stop the VM.\\nStarting the service.

To stop the image unlink the directory from / service\\nand terminate the service.\\n$ rm /etc/service/appname\\n$ cd /srv/appname\\n$ svc -t .\\nNote that only unlinking the service doesn’t stop it from running, it is just\\ntaking it away from the pool of services.

The last remaining\\nthing to do is to get Apache conﬁgured correctly. In most UNIX distribu-\\ntions this is done by modifying or adding conﬁguration ﬁles to / etc/ apache2 .\\nOn older systems the conﬁguration might also be in a directory named\\n/ etc/ httpd .\\nThe main conﬁguration ﬁle is situated in apache2.conf , or httpd.conf on older\\nsystems. Before we change the conﬁguration of the server and add the Seaside\\nweb application, have a look at this ﬁle. It is usually instructive to see how\\nthe default conﬁguration looks like and there is plenty of documentation in\\nthe conﬁguration ﬁle itself. On most systems this main conﬁguration ﬁle\\nincludes other conﬁguration ﬁles that specify what modules (plug-ins) are\\nloaded and what sites are served through the web server.\\nLoading Modules. On Debian the directory / etc/ apache2 / mods-available\\ncontains all the available modules that could be loaded. To make them\\nactually available from your conﬁguration you have to link ( ln) the .load ﬁles\\nto/ etc/ apache2 / mods-enabled . We need to do that for the proxy and rewrite\\nmodules:', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 342}),\n",

The procedure here is very\\nsimilar to the one of the modules, except that we have to write the conﬁgu-\\nration ﬁle ourselves. / etc/ apache2 / sites-available /contains conﬁguration\\ndirectives ﬁles of different virtual hosts that might be used with Apache 2.\\n/ etc/ apache2 / sites-enabled /contains links to the sites in sites-enabled /that\\nthe administrator wishes to enable.\\nStep 1.

The setting\\nProxyPreserveHost enables Seaside to ﬁgure out the server name automat-\\nically, but this setting is not available for versions prior to Apache 2. In\\nthis case you have to change the Seaside preference ‘hostname’ for all your\\napplications manually, see Section 23.1\\nRewriteEngine enables the rewrite engine that is used in the line below. The\\nlast line actually does all the magic and passes on the request to Seaside. A\\nrewrite rule always consists of 3 parts. The ﬁrst part matches the URL, in\\nthis case all URLs are matched. The second part deﬁnes how the URL is\\ntransformed. In this case this is the URL that you would use locally when\\naccessing the application. And ﬁnally, the last part in square brackets deﬁnes\\nthe actions to be taken with the transformed URL. In this case we want to\\nproxy the request, this means it should be passed to Squeak using the new\\nURL. We also tell Apache that this is the last rule to be used and no further\\nprocessing should be done.', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 343}),\n",

Check the error_log and if you\\nget an error messages in the Apache log saying client denied by server\\nconfiguration just remove the ﬁle / etc/ mods-enabled / proxy.conf from the\\nconﬁguration.\\n23.3.6 Serving ﬁles with Apache\\nMost web applications consist of serving static ﬁles at one point or the other.\\nThese are all ﬁles that don’t change over time, as opposed to the XHTML\\nof the web applications. Common static ﬁles are style sheets, Javascript\\ncode, images, videos, sound or simply document ﬁles. As we have seen in\\nChapter 17 such ﬁles can be easily served through the image, however the\\nsame drawbacks apply here as those listed in Section 23.3.\\nThe simplest way to use an external ﬁle server is to overlay a directory tree\\non the hard disk of the web server over the Seaside application. For example,\\nwhen someone requests the ﬁle http: //www.appname.com /seaside.png the\\nserver serves the ﬁle / srv/ appname / web/ seaside.png . With Apache this can be\\ndone with a few additional statements in the conﬁguration ﬁle:\\n<VirtualHost *>\\n# set server name\\nProxyPreserveHost On\\nServerName www.appname.com\\n# configure static file serving\\nDocumentRoot /srv/appname/web\\n<Directory /srv/appname/web>\\nOrder deny,allow\\nAllow from all\\n</Directory>\\n# rewrite incoming requests\\nRewriteEngine On\\nRewriteCond /srv/appname/web%{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\\nRewriteRule ^/(.*)$ http://localhost:8080/appname/$1 [proxy,last]', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 344}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='334 CHAPTER 23. DEPLOYMENT\\n</VirtualHost>\\nThe added part starts line 9 with the comment #configure static file\\nserving . Line 9 and following mark a location on the local harddisc\\nto be used as the source of ﬁles. So when someone requests the ﬁle\\nhttp://www.appname.com /seaside.png Apache will try to serve the ﬁle\\nfound at / srv/ appname / web/ seaside.png . For security reasons, the default\\nApache setup forbids serving any ﬁles from the local hard disk, even if the\\nﬁlesystem permissions allow the process to access these ﬁles. With the lines\\nbetween Directory and Directory we specify that Apache can serve all ﬁles\\nwithin / srv/ appname / web. There are many more conﬁguration options avail-\\nable there, so check out the Apache documentation.\\nThe next thing we have to do is add a condition in front of our rewrite rule.\\nAs you certainly remember, this rewrite rule passes (proxies) all incoming\\nrequests to Seaside. Now, we would only like to do this if the requested\\nﬁle does not exist on the ﬁle-system. To take the previous example again, if\\nsomebody requests http: //www.appname.com /seaside.png Apache should\\ncheck if a ﬁle named / srv/ appname / web/ seaside.png exists. This is the mean-\\ning of the line 16 where %{REQUEST_FILENAME} is a variable representing the\\nﬁle looked up, here the variable REQUEST_FILENAME is bound to seaside.png .\\nFurthermore, the cryptic expression !-fmeans that the following rewrite rule\\nshould conditionally be executed if the ﬁle speciﬁed does not exist . In our case,\\nassuming the ﬁle / srv/ appname / web/ seaside.png exists, this means that the\\nrewrite rule is skipped and Apache does the default request handling. Which\\nis to serve the static ﬁles as speciﬁed with the DocumentRoot directive. Most\\nother requests, assuming that there are only a few ﬁles in / srv/ appname / web,\\nare passed on to Seaside.\\nA typical layout of the directory / srv/ appname / webmight look like this:\\nfavicon.ico A shortcut icon, which most graphical web browsers\\nautomatically make use of. The icon is typically dis-\\nplayed next to the URL and within the list of book-\\nmarks.\\nrobots.txt A robots exclusion standard, which most search en-\\ngines request to get information on what parts of the\\nsite should be indexed.\\nresources / A subdirectory of resources used by the graphical\\ndesigner of your application.\\nresources / css/ All the CSS resources of your application.\\nresources / script /All the external Javascript ﬁles of your application.', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 345}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='23.3. DEPLOYMENT WITH APACHE 335\\n23.3.7 Load Balancing Multiple Images\\nThere are several ways to load balance Seaside images, one common way\\nis to use mod_proxy_balancer that comes with Apache. Compared to other\\nsolutions it is relatively easy to set up, does not modify the response and\\nthus has no performance impact. It requires to only load one small additional\\npackage to load into Seaside. Additionally mod_proxy_balancer provides some\\nadvanced features like a manager application, pluggable scheduler algorithms\\nand conﬁgurable load factors.\\nWhen load balancing multiple Seaside images care must be taken that all\\nrequests that require a particular session are processed by the same image,\\nbecause unless GemStone is used session do not travel between images. This\\nhas to work with and without session cookies. This is referred to as sticky\\nsessions because a session sticks to its unique image. mod_proxy_balancer\\ndoes this by associating each image with an route name. Seaside has to ap-\\npend this route to the session id. mod_proxy_balancer reads the route from\\nthe request and proxies to the appropriate image. This has the advantage\\nthat mod_proxy_balancer does not have to keep track of all the sessions and\\ndoes not have to modify the response. Additionally the mapping is de-\\nﬁned statically in the the Apache conﬁguration and is not affected by server\\nrestarts.\\nFirst we need to deﬁne our cluster of images. In this example we use two\\nimages, the ﬁrst one on port 8881 with the route name \"ﬁrst\" the second on\\nport 8882 with route name \"second\". We can of course choose other ports and\\nroute names as long as they are unique:\\n<Proxy balancer://mycluster>\\nBalancerMember http://127.0.0.1:8881 route=first\\nBalancerMember http://127.0.0.1:8882 route=second\\n</Proxy>\\nNext we need to deﬁne the actual proxy conﬁguration, which is similar to\\nwhat we do with a single Seaside image behind an Apache:\\nProxyPass / balancer://mycluster/ stickysession=_s|_s nofailover=On\\nProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:8881/\\nProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:8882/\\nNote that we conﬁgure _sto be the session id for the URL and the\\ncookie.\\nFinally, we can optionally add the balancer manager application:\\nProxyPass /balancer-manager !\\n<Location /balancer-manager>\\nSetHandler balancer-manager\\n</Location>', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 346}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"336 CHAPTER 23. DEPLOYMENT\\nAs well as an optional application displaying the server status:\\nProxyPass /server-status !\\n<Location /server-status>\\nSetHandler server-status\\n</Location>\\nPutting all the parts together this gives an apache conﬁguration like the\\nfollowing:\\n<VirtualHost *>\\nProxyRequests Off\\nProxyStatus On\\nProxyPreserveHost On\\nProxyPass /balancer-manager !\\nProxyPass /server-status !\\nProxyPass / balancer://mycluster/ STICKYSESSION=_s|_s\\nProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:8881/\\nProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:8882/\\n<Proxy balancer://mycluster>\\nBalancerMember http://127.0.0.1:8881 route=first\\nBalancerMember http://127.0.0.1:8882 route=second\\n</Proxy>\\n<Location /balancer-manager>\\nSetHandler balancer-manager\\n</Location>\\n<Location /server-status>\\nSetHandler server-status\\n</Location>\\n</VirtualHost>\\nThe rest can be conﬁgured from within Seaside. First we need to load the\\npackage Seaside-Cluster from http: //www.squeaksource.com /ajp/. Then\\nwe need to conﬁgure each image individually with the correct route name.\\nIt is important that this matches the Apache conﬁguration from above. The\\neasiest way to do this is evaluate the expression:\\nWAAdmin makeAllClusteredWith: ' first '\\nin the image on port 8881 and\\nWAAdmin makeAllClusteredWith: ' second '\\nin the image on port 8882.\\nThis is it, the cluster is ready to go.

This setup is straightforward and enough for smaller\\nproductive applications.\\nAs your web application becomes widely used, you want to regularly provide\\nﬁxes and new features to your users. Also you might want to investigate and\\ndebug the deployed server. To do that, you need a way to get our hands on\\nthe running Smalltalk VM. There are several possibilities to do that, we are\\ngoing to look at those in this section.\\n23.4.1 Headful System\\nInstead of running the VM headless as we did in Section 23.3.4, it is also\\npossible to run it headful as you do during development. This is common\\npractice on Windows servers, but it is rarely done on Unix. Normally servers\\ndoesn’t come with a windowing system for performance and security reasons.\\nManaging a headful image is straightforward, so we will not be discussing\\nthis case further.\\n23.4.2 Virtual Network Computing\\nA common technique is to run a VNC server within your deployed image.\\nVNC (Virtual Network Computing) is a graphical desktop sharing system,\", metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 349}),\n",

The server constantly\\nsends graphical screen updates through the network using a remote frame\\nbuffer (RFB) protocol, and the client sends back keyboard and mouse events.\\nVNC is platform independent and there are several open-source server and\\nclient implementations available.\\nFigure 23.5: Starting the RFB Server in Pharo.\\nPharo comes with a VNC client and server implementation, which can op-\\ntionally be loaded. It is called Remote Frame Buffer (RFB) .

Now you are\\nable to connect to the Pharo screen using any VNC client. Either using the\\nbuilt-in client from a different Pharo image, or more likely using any other\\nnative client. Now you are able to connect to the server image from anywhere\\nin the world, and this even works if the image is started headless. This is\\nvery useful to be able to directly interact with server images, for example to\\nupdate code or investigate and ﬁx a problem in the running image.\\n23.4.3 Deployment Tools\\nSeaside comes with several tools included that help you with the management\\nof deployed applications.

In some cases, it\\nmight be necessary to provide a REST API to increase the usability and inter-\\noperability of a web application though. Luckily Seaside provides a Seaside\\nREST package to ﬁll the gap and to allow one to mix both approaches.\\nIn this chapter, we show how to integrate web applications with Seaside REST\\nservices. We start with a short presentation of REST. Then we deﬁne a simple\\nREST service for the todo application we implemented in Chapter 15. We\\nﬁnish this chapter by inspecting how HTTP requests and responses work. We\\nwant to thank Olivier Auverlot for providing us with an initial draft of this\\nchapter in French.\\n24.1 REST in a Nutshell\\nREST (Representational State Transfer) refers to an architectural model for the\\ndesign of web services. It was deﬁned by Roy Fielding in his dissertation on\\nArchitectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures.\\nThe REST architecture is based on the following simple ideas:\\n• REST uses URIs to refer to and to access resources.\\n• REST is built on top of the stateless HTTP 1.1 protocol.\\n• REST uses HTTP commands to deﬁne operations.\\nThis last point is essential in REST architecture. HTTP commands have precise\\nsemantics:\\n• GET lists or retrieves a resource at a given URI.\\n343', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 354}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='344 CHAPTER 24. REST SERVICES\\n• PUT replaces or updates a resource at a given URI.\\n• POST creates a resources at a given URI.\\n• DELETE removes the resources at a given URI.\\nSeaside takes a different approach by default: Seaside generates URIs auto-\\nmatically, Seaside keeps state on the server, and Seaside does not interact\\nwell with HTTP commands. While the approach of Seaside simpliﬁes a lot of\\nthings in web development, sometimes it is necessary to play with the rules.\\nREST is used by a large number of web products and adhering to the REST\\nstandard might increase the usability of an application.\\nREST applications with Seaside can take two shapes: The ﬁrst approach\\ncreates or extends the interoperability of an existing application by adding\\na REST API. Web browsers and other client applications can (programmat-\\nically) access the functionality and data of an application server, see Fig-\\nure 24.1.\\nFigure 24.1: First architecture: adding REST to an existing application.\\nA second approach consists of using REST as the back-end of an application\\nand make it a fundamental element of its architecture. All objects are exposed\\nvia REST services to potential clients as well as to the other parts of the\\napplication such as its Seaside user-interface, see Figure 24.2.\\nThis second approach offers a low coupling and eases deployment. Load-\\nbalacing and fail-over mechanisms can easily be put in place and the applica-\\ntion can be distributed over multiple machines.\\nWith Seaside and its Rest package you can implement both architectures. In\\nthis chapter we are going to look at the ﬁrst example only, that is we will\\nextend an existing application with a REST API.', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 355}),\n",

You might want to use any other framework\\nor technique to build your output strings.\\nBy specifying the accept-header we can verify that our implementation serves\\nthe expected implementations:\\n$ curl -H \"Accept: text/json\" http://localhost:8080/todo-api\\n[{\"title\": \"Finish todo app chapter\", \"done\": false},\\n{\"title\": \"Annotate first chapter\", \"done\": true},\\n{\"title\": \"Discuss cover design\", \"done\": false},\\n{\"title\": \"Give REST a try\", \"done\": true}]', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 360}),\n",

This illustrates that several methods can get a get annotation and\\nthat one is selected and executed depending on the information available in\\nthe request. We explain this point later.\\nSimilarly the client can specify the MIME type of data passed to the server\\nusing the content-type header.

The WARestfulFilter simply wraps a Seaside application.\\nThat is, it handles REST requests exactly as the WARestfulHandler , but it can\\nalso delegate to the wrapped Seaside application.\\nTo update our existing service we rename ToDoHandler to ToDoFilter and\\nchange its superclass to WARestfulFilter .

We have two possibilities to ﬁx the\\nproblem:\\n1.We remove the method #list so that ToDoFilter automatically calls\\nnoRouteFound: that eventually calls the application.\\n2.We add a new service that captures requests directed at our web appli-\\ncation and explicitly dispatches them to the Seaside application.

REST SERVICES\\n24.6 Advices and Conclusion\\nThis chapter shows that while Seaside provides a powerful way to build\\ndynamic application using a stateful approach, it can also seamlessly in-\\ntegrate with existing stateless protocols. This chapter illustrated that an\\nobject-oriented model of an application in combination with Seaside can be\\nvery powerful: You can develop ﬂexible web interfaces as composable Seaside\\ncomponents, and you can easily enrich them with an API for interoperability\\nwith REST clients. Seaside provides you with the best of all worlds: the power\\nof object-design, the ﬂexibility and elegance of Seaside components, and the\\nintegration of traditional HTTP architectures.\\nA piece of advice:\\n•Do not use cookies with a REST service. Such service should respect\\nthe stateless philosophie of HTTP . Each request should be independent\\nof others.\\n•During the development, organize your tagged methods following the\\nHTTP commands: (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD). You can use\\nprotocols to access them faster.\\n•A good service web should be able to produce different types of contents\\ndepending on the capabilities of the clients. Been able to produce\\ndifferent formats such as plain text (text /plain), XML (text /xml), or\\nJSON (text /json) increases the interoperability of your web services.\\nYou should now have a better understanding of the possibilities offered by\\nSeaside-REST and be ready to produce nice web services.', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 367}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Chapter 25\\nSome Persistency\\nApproaches\\nOne important question when building applications is how to save their data.\\nThis question is not directly linked to Seaside, but we want to provide some\\npossible solutions to help you get started. Several solutions exist to save\\nyour data. We will present some of the ones that are available in Squeak and\\nthat are based on open-source software. We will cover multiple solutions\\nbased on image snapshots, active record-like behavior, and object-oriented\\ndatabases. We will not cover in detail Object-Relational mapping solutions\\nsuch as GLORP (an open-source object-relational mapper). The book “An\\nIntroduction to Seaside” by Michael Perscheid et al. presents a nice introduc-\\ntion to GLORP and we point the interested reader to this book. Cincom offers\\nWebVelocity (see Chapter 3) to support the deﬁnition of web applications us-\\ning Seaside and scaffolding of applications. For the persistency, WebVelocity\\nuses GLORP . There are some efforts to support OpenDBX in Squeak. The list\\nof support will certainly grow and we may extend it as well.\\nThe purest deﬁnition of “persistence” is capturing the state of memory to\\nsecondary storage (disk) so that work on the meaningful object model may\\ncontinue later; and this is the primary purpose of any persistence framework.\\nAnother useful purpose, however, is to accommodate very large models\\nthat cannot ﬁt entirely in RAM. Capable persistence frameworks manage\\nlarge models by paging portions of the model into RAM as necessary for\\nconsumption or updates, and paging it out to make room for other parts of\\nthe model. One job of an object-database is to do this as transparently to the\\ndeveloper as possible.\\nOf course, Smalltalk vendors offer speciﬁc solutions for persistency ranging\\nfrom object-relational mapping to object-oriented databases.

The GemStone\\napproach offers a robust and scalable object-oriented environment for Seaside.\\nWith GemStone you don’t have to think about persistency at all, the fact that\\nobjects are persistent in an industrial strength database is part of the language.\\nGemStone offers GLASS, a 4 GiB persistent image that just magically solves\\nmost of your persistency problems. GLASS can be a really important option\\nfor persistency when you really need to scale in the Seaside world; however,\\nit requires a 64 bit server and introduces the small additional complexity of\\nchanging to a different Smalltalk and learning its class library.\\nA little note. Most applications don’t need to scale. They need to be robust\\nand solve client problems. Most real world applications are written to run\\nsmall businesses. In all likelihood, scaling is not and probably won’t ever\\nbe your problem. We might like to think we’re writing the next YouTube or\\nTwitter, but odds are we’re not. You can make a career just replacing spread\\nsheets with simple applications that make people’s lives easier without ever\\nonce hitting the limits of a single Squeak image (such was the inspiration\\nfor DabbleDB), so don’t waste your time scaling (yet). Spend your time on\\nsolving client problems and building robust software. If scaling ever becomes\\na problem, be happy, it’s a nice problem and your clients will pay for it.\\nIn contrast to other “web frameworks” Seaside does not provide a ready-\\nmade persistency solution for you. We consider this to be an advantage,\\nSeaside lets you choose the database technology that ﬁts your needs the best\\nand concentrates on what it is strong at, web application development.\\nIn this chapter we will present several persistency solutions of various degrees\\nof scalability and simplicity. First we will describe some simple image-based\\nand object serialization solutions. Then we present SandstoneDB which offers\\nanActive Record -style API (even if it does not offer transactional semantics,\\nconcurrent accesses) and use the image as a persistency. Finally we present\\nMagma: an object-oriented database based on a write-barrier. This approach\\nis similar to the one of GOODS.\\n25.1 Image-Based Persistence\\nWhile a Smalltalk image should not really be used as an artifact of code man-\\nagement (you should use Monticello packages, change-sets, Store packages\\nto manage your code elements and build your image from packages), it can\\nbe used to store objects. With some precaution you can use the image as\\na simple and powerful object-oriented database. Therefore you can delay\\nthe need to hook up a database during much of your development and of-\\nten your deployment.

This is why solutions like Prevayler based on the\\nCommand design pattern have emerged over the years. Such approaches\\nmimic the notion of the Smalltalk image, even if they offer a better store\\ngranularity.\\nNot directly using a relational database will also ease the evolution of your\\napplication which in case of the prototyping phase will certainly do. In\\naddition, working with full objects all the way down is more productive. So\\nlet’s have a look at image storage mechanisms.\\nThe simplest approach is the following: you save your image. Now if the\\nimage crashes because for example your disc is full, you are in trouble. The\\nsecond level is to perform several backups. Later on you can switch to an\\nobject-oriented database approach such as GOODS, Magma or GemStone.\\nOf course saving an image does not work well if you have to share data\\nbetween different applications not running in the same image. So you get the\\nsimplicity and the limits of simplicity too.\\nSaving an image. The expression SmalltalkImage current saveSession saves\\nan image, i.e., all the objects that are accessible in your system. Now based\\non that we can build a small utility class.

For the ToDo application,\\neach time an item is changed, added or removed would be a possibility.\\nHaving an explicit save button is another solution. We let you decide for your\\napplication.\\nOn a Mac Book pro with around ten applications running in parallel, it takes\\nabout 1100 ms to save the Seaside image which highly depends on the size\\nof the image. Therefore, this will have an inﬂuence on choice. For two lines\\nof code, this is a good tradeoff.

SandstoneDB is a\\nlightweight Prevayler style embedded object database with an ActiveRe-\\ncord API. It is available for Pharo and GNU Smalltalk. SandstoneDB doesn’t\\nrequire a command pattern and works for small apps that a single Pharo\\nimage can handle. SandstoneDB is a simple, fast, conﬁguration free, crash\\nproof, easy to use object database that doesn’t require heavy thinking to use.\\nIt allows you to build and iterate prototypes and small applications quickly\\nwithout having to keep a schema in sync. SandstoneDB is a simple object\\ndatabase that uses SmartRefStream to serialize clusters of objects to disk (com-\\npared to the above approach it can save the model in increments, not the\\nwhole model when only something small changes).\\nThe idea is to make a Squeak image durable and crash proof and suitable for\\nuse in small ofﬁce applications. SandstoneDB and Seaside give what the Rails\\nand ActiveRecord guys have, simple fast persistence that just works, simply.\\nIt also gets the additional beneﬁt of no mapping and no SQL queries, instead\\nwe use plain Smalltalk iterators.\\nWith Sandstone, data is kept in RAM for speed and on disk for safety. All\\ndata is reloaded from disk on image startup. Since objects live in memory,\\nconcurrency is handled via optional record level critical sections rather than\\noptimistic locking and commit failures. It’s up to the developer to use critical\\nsections at the appropriate points by using the critical method on the record.\\nSaves are atomic for an ActiveRecord and all its non-ActiveRecord children,\\nfor example, an order and its items. There is no atomic save across multiple\\nActiveRecords. A record is a cluster of objects that are stored in a single ﬁle\\ntogether.\\nContrary to the image-based persistence schema described at the beginning of\\nthis chapter, SandstoneDB is more like an OODB. It slices out part of the object\\ngraph and commits just that record and its children to a single temp ﬁle. Once\\nsuccessfully written it’s renamed into place to make the commit as atomic as\\npossible. First the new record is written to a ﬁle named objectid.new, then the\\ncurrent record which is named objectid.obj is renamed to objectid.obj.version,\\nand the change is ﬁnally committed by renaming objectid.new to objectid.obj.\\nThe recovery process takes this into account and can tell at what point the\\ncrash occurred by what the ﬁle names are and recovers appropriately. There’s\\na recovery process that runs on image startup to ﬁnish partial commits and\\nclean up failed commits that may have happened during a crash. Since\\ncommits on objects are explicit, there’s no need to for any kind of change\\nnotiﬁcation or change tracking.\\nAbout Aggregate. The root of each cluster is an ActiveRecord. It makes', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 377}),\n",

SANDSTONE: AN ACTIVE-RECORD IMAGE-BASED APPROACH 367\\nActiveRecord a bit more object-oriented by treating it as an aggregate root\\nand its class as a repository for its instances.\\nA good example of an aggregate root object is an Order class, while its LineItem\\nclass just be an ordinary Smalltalk object. A BlogPost is an aggregate root\\nwhile a BlogComment is an ordinary Smalltalk object. Order and BlogPost would\\nbe ActiveRecords. This allows you to query for Order and BlogPost but not for\\nLineItem and BlogComment , which is as it should be, those items don’t make\\nmuch sense outside the context of their aggregate root and no other object in\\nthe system should be allowed to reference them directly, only aggregate roots\\nare referenced by other ActiveRecords. This will cause the entire cluster to be\\ncommitted atomically by calling anOrder commit .\\nTo start. To use SandstoneDB, just subclass SDActiveRecord and save your\\nimage to ensure the proper directories are created, that’s it, there is no further\\nconﬁguration. The database is kept in a subdirectory matching the name of\\nthe class in the same directory as the image. Following the idea of Prevayler\\nall data is kept in memory, then written to disk on save or commit and on\\nsystem startup, all data is loaded from disk back into memory. This keeps the\\nimage small. Like Prevayler, there’s a startup cost associated with loading\\nall the instances into memory and rebuilding the object graph, however once\\nloaded, accessing your objects is blazing fast and you don’t need to worry\\nabout indexing or special query syntaxes like you would with an on disk\\ndatabase. This of course limits the size of the database to whatever you’re\\nwilling to put up with in load time and whatever you can ﬁt in RAM.\\n25.3.1 The SandstoneDB API\\nSandstoneDB has a very simple API for querying and iterating on the classes\\nrepresenting the repository for their instances:\\nClass Query API.

The typical usage\\npattern is to create a connection to the OODB server which basically presents\\nitself to you as a persistent dictionary of some sort where you put objects\\ninto it and then commit any unsaved changes. They will save any object and\\nleave it up to you what your object should look like, intruding as little as\\npossible on your domain, so they say. In Pharo and Squeak, one possible\\nsolution explored by SqueakSave (a new framework to save objects in Squeak)\\nis to turn the root class SDActiveRecord into a trait (trait are compiled-time\\ngroup of methods) and to apply the trait to your classes. Behind the scenes\\nthere’s some voodoo going on where this persistent dictionary tries to ﬁgure\\nout what’s actually been changed either by having installed some sort of\\nwrite barrier that marks objects dirty automatically when they get changed,\\ncomparing your objects to a cached copy created when they were originally\\nread, or sometimes even explicitly forcing the programmer to manually mark\\nthe object dirty. The point of all of this complexity is to minimize writes to\\nthe disk to reduce IO and keep things snappy. This is what we will see next\\nwith Magma.\\n25.4 Magma: an Object-Oriented Database\\nMagma is an open-source object-oriented database developed entirely in\\nSmalltalk. Magma provides transparent access to a large-scale shared per-\\nsistent object model. It supports multiple users concurrently via optimistic\\nlocking. It uses a simple transaction protocol, including nested transactions,\\nsupports collaborative program development via live class evolution, peer-\\nto-peer model sharing and Monticello integration. Magma supports large,\\nindexed collections with robust querying, runs with pretty good performance\\nand provides performance tuning mechanisms. Magma is fault tolerant and\\nincludes a small suite of tools. Magma can either work locally or on a remote\\nMagma server. This means, multiple images can access the same database\\nconcurrently.\\nMagma provides safe access and management to multiple, large, intercon-\\nnected models over the network, by multiple users, simultaneously. In keep-\\ning with the simplicity of the other frameworks, it “just works” out of the\\nbox with comparably little API and learning curve. Developers will appre-\\nciate there is no need to inherit from a special superclass and no need to\\nsignal changed-notiﬁcations anywhere. There are a lot of options but the\\ndefaults will work ﬁne without any consideration. Servers running when the\\nimage is closed and reopened are automatically restarted, connected clients\\nare automatically reconnected. Recovery from hardware failures also occurs\\nautomatically, guaranteeing integrity.', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 382}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"372 CHAPTER 25. SOME PERSISTENCY APPROACHES\\n25.4.1 How it works\\nA running Magma server is never required to deal with actual instances of the\\ndomain, it is really nothing more than a buffer server. The persistent model\\nis encapsulated into serialized object buffers that are relationally-linked by\\ntheir oid(object-id). Here is the entire class hierarchy:\\nMaObjectBuffer #( ' byteArray ' ' startPos ' )\\nMaFixedObjectBuffer #()\\nMaVariableBuffer #()\\nMaByteObjectBuffer #()\\nMaStorageObjectBuffer #()\\nMaVariableObjectBuffer #()\\nMaVariableWordBuffer #()\\nEvery single Magma repository consists of many thousands (millions, billions,\\netc.) of these buffers written to various object ﬁles (note that each Magma\\nrepository is physically stored in its own directory of ﬁles, you should not\\nremove these Magma-generated ﬁles via the OS, or add any additional ﬁles).\\nThis ﬁrst-class representation of the buffers allows the Magma server to\\ndance over any part of the domain with agility, rapidly supplying request-\\ning clients with object-answers to their requests by way of the “Ma client\\nserver” supporting package, the high-performance client-server framework\\nfor Squeak.\\nAfter receiving the chunk of buffers from the server, Magma clients translate\\nthem into the domain instances, constructing the model and attaching it\\ncorrectly to the existing cached model. Of course the model is rendered\\nexactly true to its original shape, cycles and all. The “edges” of the cached\\ndomain model are terminated by Proxy instances which will automatically\\nmutate that portion of the model if the program ventures there.\\nThis constant conversion to and from the MaObjectBuffer instance format\\ndoes mean Magma runs more slowly for a single-user than the all-in-memory\\nframeworks. At least until the model grows beyond 100MB. At that point,\\nevery single save in the all-in-memory is writing out another 100MB, but\\nMagma will automatically determine only the objects that changed and write\\nout only those changes. Even further, the level of performance can be main-\\ntained indeﬁnitely as the size of the model or number of users increases, by\\nadding additional servers as necessary. Magma constantly monitors and\\ncaptures extensive performance statistics, allowing developers to ﬁne-tune\\ntheir programs to maximize use of the available resources.\\nMagma is a safe place to maintain a Squeak object model important to you\\nor your organization. It supports full-backup and DR replication for rapid\\nfailover, out of the box. The generic structure of the storage is simple, well\\ndocumented, has remained compatible across many Squeak versions and will\\ncontinue to do so\", metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 383}),\n",

GLORP is non-\\nintrusive in the sense that the object model does not have to store foreign keys\\nin objects and that you can map an arbitrary domain model to an arbitrary\\nrelational model.\\nGLORP allows you to manipulate databases with a low-level interface. You\\ncan create databases, create sessions, add /remove rows, select a row and\\nso on. However this interface is low-level and GLORP offers a high-level\\ninterface. When you are using the higher-level API, GLORP watches for\\ndirty objects (i.e., objects whose state has been changed since the transaction\\nbegan), and then automatically writes those objects to the RDBMS when you\\ncommit the transaction. The required SQL is automatically generated and\\nyou don’t need to ever explicitly write any SQL yourself, or otherwise need to\\nexplicitly manipulate the rows yourself. In addition GLORP preserves object\\nidentity when objects are fetched several times from the database. GLORP\\nuses a clever object cache.\\nGLORP uses meta-data to deﬁne the mapping between the objects and the\\nrelational database. The meta-data is a declarative description of the cor-\\nrespondence between an object and its database representation. It is used\\nto drive reads, writes, joins, and anything else that is needed. SQL code\\nshould not ever have to be explicitly created, as it is autogenerated through\\nthe mappings (i.e., through the meta-data). In GLORP queries are expressed\\nin terms of objects and composable expressions.\\nWe will not cover GLORP in this book.

Most descriptions belong to this group, such as\\nthe ColorDescription , the DateDescription , the NumberDescription , the\\nStringDescription , the BooleanDescription , etc. All of them describe a\\nspeciﬁc Smalltalk class; in the examples given, this would be Color,\\nDate, Number and all its subclasses, String, and Boolean and its two\\nsubclasses True and False.

If a model object is described, it is often neces-\\nsary to keep a set of other descriptions within a collection, for example\\nthe description of a person consists of a description of the title, the\\nfamily name, the birthday, etc. The ContainerDescription class and its\\nsubclasses provide a collection container for other descriptions. In fact\\nthe container implements the whole collection interface, so that users\\ncan easily iterate ( do:), ﬁlter ( select: , reject: ), transform ( collect: )\\nand query ( detect: , anySatisfy: , allSatisfy: ) the containing descrip-\\ntions.\\n3.Option Descriptions. The SingleOptionDescription describes an entity,\\nfor which it is possible to choose up to one item from a list of objects.\\nThe MultipleOptionDescription describes a collection, for which it is\\npossible to choose any number of items from a predeﬁned list of objects.\\nThe selected items are described by the referencing description.\\n4.Relationship Descriptions. Probably the most advanced de-\\nscriptions are the ones that describe relationships between ob-\\njects. The ToOneRelationshipDescription models a one-to-one rela-\\ntionship; the ToManyRelationshipDescription models a one-to-many\\nrelationship using a Smalltalk collection.

Magritte calls such validation conditions associated with a description.\\nA condition is simply a block that returns true or false.

We need to add the rule in a\\nplace where we can ensure all single ﬁeld data exists but before it’s written to\\nthe object from the mementos.\\nWe need to add a rule to the objects container description like this\\ndescriptionContainer\\n^ super descriptionContainer\\naddCondition: [ :object |\\n(object readUsing: self descriptionEndDate) >\\n(object readUsing: self descriptionStartDate)]\\nlabelled: ' End date must be after start date ' ;\\nyourself\\nThis simply intercepts the container after it is built, and adds a multi ﬁeld\\nvalidation by accessing the potential value of those ﬁelds. You get the me-\\nmento for the object, and all the ﬁeld values are in its cache, keyed by their\\ndescriptions. You simply read the values and validate them before they have\\na chance to be written to the real business object. Multi ﬁeld validations are\\na bit more complicated than single ﬁeld validations but this pattern works\\nwell.\\n26.6 Accessors and Mementos\\nAccessors. In Smalltalk data can be accessed and stored in different ways.\\nMost common data is stored within instance variables and read and written\\nusing accessor methods, but sometimes developers choose other strategies,\\nfor example to group data within a referenced object, to keep their data\\nstored within a dictionary, or to calculate it dynamically from block closures.\\nMagritte uses a strategy pattern to be able to access the data through a\\ncommon interface, see Figure 26.9.\\nBy far the most commonly used accessor type is the SelectorAccessor . It can\\nbe instantiated with two selectors: a zero argument selector to read, and a one\", metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 397}),\n",

For convenience it is possible to specify a read\\nselector only, from which the write selector is inferred automatically.\\nThe MADictionaryAccessor is used to add and retrieve data from a dictionary\\nwith a given key. This access strategy is mainly used for prototyping as\\nit allows one to treat dictionaries like objects with object-based instance\\nvariables.\\nWhen a memento writes valid data to its model, it does so through accessors\\nwhich are also deﬁned by the descriptions. MAAccessor subclasses allow you\\nto deﬁne how a value gets written to your class.\\nMementos. Magritte introduces mementos that behave like the original\\nmodel and that delay modiﬁcations until they are proven to be valid. When\\ncomponents read and write to domain objects, they do it using memen-\\ntos rather than working directly on the objects. The default memento is\\nMACheckedMemento . The mementos give Magritte a place to store invalid form\\ndata prior to allowing the data to be committed to the domain object. It also\\nallows Magritte to detect concurrency conﬂicts. By never committing invalid\\ndata to domain objects, there’s never a need to roll anything back. So memen-\\ntos are good since editing might turn a model (temporarily) invalid, canceling\\nan edit shouldn’t change the model and concurrent edits of the same model\\nshould be detected and (manually) merged. mementoClass is a class factory\\nthat you can specialize to specify your own memento. But normally you\\nshould not need that.\\nFigure 26.10: Mementos (simpliﬁed version).', metadata={'source': 'samples/tutorial_Class.pdf', 'page': 398}),\n",

Some descriptions have an\\nobvious one to one relationship with a UI component while others could\\neasily be shown by several different components. Figure 26.11 shows some\\ncomponents. For example, an MAMemoDescription would be represented by a\\ntext area, but a MABooleanDescription could be a checkbox, or a drop down\\nwith true and false, or a radio group with true and false.\\nEach description defaults to a component, but allows you to override and\\nspecify any component you choose, including any custom one you may write\\nusing the message Description >> componentClass: .\\naDescription componentClass: aClass\\nFigure 26.11: Some Magritte speciﬁc widgets.\\nYou can also deﬁne your own view by following the steps:\\n• Create a subclass of MADescriptionComponent .\\n• Override renderEditorOn: and/or renderViewerOn: as necessary.\\n•Use your custom view together with your description by using the\\naccessor componentClass: .\\n•Possibly add your custom view to its description into\\ndefaultComponentClasses .\\n26.8 Custom Descriptions\\nIn some cases it might happen that there is no description provided to use\\nwith a class.

A good and small example to learn from is the Conrad conference\\nmanagement system developed to manage the ESUG conference available\\nat http: //www.squeaksource.com /Conrad.html.
